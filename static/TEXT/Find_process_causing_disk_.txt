Linux something is very actively reading my disk, how do i find the process?

When you notice that your Linux system's disk activity is unusually high and you want to identify the process causing it, you can use various commands to investigate. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

1. **Check Disk Activity**: To get an overview of disk activity, you can use the `iotop` command. This tool provides real-time monitoring of disk I/O usage by processes.

   ```bash
   sudo iotop
   ```

   Running this command will display a list of processes along with their disk I/O usage. The processes with the highest I/O usage are likely the ones causing the disk activity.

2. **Check Disk Usage**: Sometimes high disk activity can be caused by processes writing a lot of data to disk. You can use the `du` command to check disk usage.

   ```bash
   du -sh /path/to/directory
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/directory` with the directory you suspect might be responsible for the high disk activity.

3. **Check System Logs**: System logs can also provide valuable information about disk activity. You can use the `journalctl` command to view system logs.

   ```bash
   journalctl -xe
   ```

   Look for any error messages or unusual activity that might indicate which process is causing the disk activity.

4. **Check Processes**: You can use the `ps` command to list all processes running on your system.

   ```bash
   ps aux
   ```

   Look for processes that are using a lot of CPU or memory, as they might also be responsible for the high disk activity.

5. **Check Disk I/O Stats**: You can use the `iostat` command to check disk I/O statistics.

   ```bash
   iostat -x 1
   ```

   This command will display disk I/O statistics every second. Look for processes that have a high number of reads or writes.

6. **Check Disk Space**: Sometimes high disk activity can be caused by low disk space. Use the `df` command to check disk space usage.

   ```bash
   df -h
   ```

   If your disk is nearly full, it could be causing excessive disk activity due to file system operations.

By following these steps and analyzing the output of each command, you should be able to identify the process causing the high disk activity on your Linux system. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!

alias free='free -h -s 5 -c 5'&&'sudo iotop'

It seems like you're trying to create an alias to combine the `free` and `iotop` commands. However, the syntax you provided is incorrect. Let me correct it for you:

```bash
alias free='free -h -s 5 -c 5 && sudo iotop'
```

This alias will execute `free -h -s 5 -c 5` to display memory usage every 5 seconds for 5 iterations, and then it will execute `sudo iotop` to run `iotop` with superuser privileges to monitor disk I/O usage.

You can add this line to your shell configuration file (such as `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`) to make the alias permanent. After adding it, either restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` (or `source ~/.zshrc` if you're using Zsh) for the changes to take effect.

After setting up the alias, you can simply type `free` in your terminal to execute both commands concurrently. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!

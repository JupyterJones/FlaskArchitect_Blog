Hey Jack! Starting a second YouTube channel can be an exciting venture. Since you're already familiar with Python, let me help you with a script that automates the process of creating a new YouTube channel. We'll use the YouTube Data API for this task.

Firstly, make sure you have the necessary packages installed:

```bash
pip install google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client
```

Now, here's a Python script to create a new YouTube channel:

```python
import os
import google_auth_oauthlib.flow
import googleapiclient.discovery
from google.auth.transport.requests import Request

# Set up OAuth 2.0
SCOPES = ["https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.force-ssl"]
API_SERVICE_NAME = "youtube"
API_VERSION = "v3"

def get_authenticated_service():
    creds = None
    # The file token.json stores the user's access and refresh tokens, and is created automatically when the
    # authorization flow completes for the first time.
    token_path = "token.json"

    if os.path.exists(token_path):
        creds = None
    # If there are no (valid) credentials available, let the user log in.
    if not creds or not creds.valid:
        if creds and creds.expired and creds.refresh_token:
            creds.refresh(Request())
        else:
            flow = google_auth_oauthlib.flow.InstalledAppFlow.from_client_secrets_file(
                "client_secret.json", SCOPES
            )
            creds = flow.run_local_server(port=0)

        # Save the credentials for the next run
        with open(token_path, "w") as token:
            token.write(creds.to_json())

    return googleapiclient.discovery.build(API_SERVICE_NAME, API_VERSION, credentials=creds)

def create_new_channel(title, description):
    youtube = get_authenticated_service()

    request = youtube.channels().insert(
        part="snippet,brandingSettings,contentDetails",
        body={
            "snippet": {
                "title": title,
                "description": description,
            },
            "brandingSettings": {
                "channel": {
                    "defaultTab": "home",
                },
            },
            "contentDetails": {
                "defaultLanguage": "en-US",
            },
        },
    )

    response = request.execute()

    channel_id = response["id"]
    print(f"New channel created with ID: {channel_id}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Replace these with your desired channel title and description
    channel_title = "Your New Channel"
    channel_description = "Description of your new channel."

    create_new_channel(channel_title, channel_description)
```

Make sure to replace `"client_secret.json"` with the path to your client secret file, and customize the `channel_title` and `channel_description` variables.

This script will create a new YouTube channel with the specified title and description. It uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication and the YouTube Data API to interact with YouTube. Remember to keep your API credentials secure. If you have any questions or need further explanation, feel free to ask!

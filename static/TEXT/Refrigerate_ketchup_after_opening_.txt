Catsup, also known as ketchup, is a condiment that typically contains vinegar and tomatoes, which have natural preservatives. As a result, commercially produced ketchup often does not require immediate refrigeration before opening. However, refrigerating it can help preserve its quality and flavor for a longer time.

Once opened, it's recommended to refrigerate ketchup to maintain its freshness and prevent spoilage. If you're using a commercially bottled ketchup, check the label for specific storage instructions, as they may vary between brands.

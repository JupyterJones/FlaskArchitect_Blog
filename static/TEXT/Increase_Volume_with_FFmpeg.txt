Increase Volume with FFmpeg
user
ffmpeg -f alsa -i plughw:0,0 -f pulse -i default -y 000.mp3
can i increase volumn here ?

Yes, you can increase the volume of the audio in your FFmpeg command by using the `volume` filter. You can specify the volume level you want to increase it to.

Here's how you can modify your command to increase the volume:

```bash
ffmpeg -f alsa -i plughw:0,0 -f pulse -i default -filter:a "volume=2.0" -y 000.mp3
```

In this command, I've added the `-filter:a "volume=2.0"` option. This will increase the volume by a factor of 2.0. You can adjust the volume level as needed. For example, a value of 1.0 would keep the volume the same, less than 1.0 would decrease it, and greater than 1.0 would increase it. Adjust the value accordingly to achieve the desired volume level.

It looks like you're trying to capture the screen (`x11grab`) along with audio inputs (`alsa` and `pulse`) and concatenate them into a single video file. However, the error message indicates an issue with the `concat` filter, specifically with unlabeled input pad 3.

To fix this, you need to label all input pads explicitly in the `filter_complex` filtergraph. Here's the modified command with labeled input pads:

```bash
ffmpeg -f x11grab -i :0.0 -f alsa -i plughw:0,0 -f pulse -i default -filter_complex "[0:v]scale=1280:720[v];[1:a][2:a]concat=n=2:v=0:a=1[aout]" -map "[v]" -map "[aout]" -c:v libx264 -r 24 -g 48 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -t 56 -y test0.mp4
```

In this command:

- `[0:v]` represents the video input from the screen capture.
- `[1:a]` represents the audio input from the first alsa device.
- `[2:a]` represents the audio input from the pulse device.
- `concat=n=2:v=0:a=1[aout]` concatenates the audio streams.

Make sure to adjust the filtergraph according to your specific requirements. This command should concatenate the audio streams correctly without encountering the "Cannot find a matching stream" error.

It seems there are some issues with the placement of options and filters in your FFmpeg command. Let's correct it:

```bash
ffmpeg -f x11grab -framerate 24 -video_size 1366x760 -i :0.0 -f alsa -i plughw:0,0 -f pulse -i default -filter_complex "[0:v]scale=1280:720[v];[1:a][2:a]concat=n=2:v=0:a=1[aout]" -map "[v]" -map "[aout]" -c:v libx264 -r 24 -g 48 -c:a aac -b:a 128k -t 56 -y test0.mp4
```

In this corrected command:

- `-filter_complex` is followed by the filtergraph within double quotes.
- The concatenation of audio streams is fixed within the `concat` filter.
- The `-c:v` option is removed from the `filter_complex` filtergraph as it doesn't belong there.
- The `-c:v libx264` option is correctly placed before the output filename.

This command should capture the screen, audio from alsa and pulse, scale the video to 1280x720, concatenate the audio streams, and encode the output video using libx264 codec and AAC codec for audio.

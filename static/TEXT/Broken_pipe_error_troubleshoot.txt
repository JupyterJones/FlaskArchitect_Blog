The `BrokenPipeError` typically occurs when one end of a pipe (a data stream) is closed unexpectedly while the other end is still trying to read or write data. This can happen when using piping in a command-line operation, and the receiving process terminates prematurely.

In your case, the error could be due to how the `facemorpher` command is being executed. The use of the pipe (`|`) suggests you are trying to pass the output of `facemorpher` to another command, but it seems like there's a syntax issue.

To use the `facemorpher` tool properly, you need to ensure that the command is structured correctly. Here is an example of how you might use the `facemorpher` command:

```bash
facemorpher --src=image_001.jpg --dest=image_002.jpg --out_folder=output
```

In this command:
- `--src` specifies the source image.
- `--dest` specifies the destination image.
- `--out_folder` specifies the output folder where the morphed images will be saved.

Ensure that you have the `facemorpher` tool installed and accessible in your environment. If you are still encountering issues, please provide more details about how you installed `facemorpher` and the exact steps you are taking. This will help in diagnosing the problem further.

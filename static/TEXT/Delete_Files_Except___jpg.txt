I'm sorry, but I can't directly interact with your files or system to perform actions like deleting files. If you're looking to delete files with a specific extension like "*.jpg," you'll need to use commands in a terminal or file manager on your system. 

For example, if you're using a Unix-like system (Linux or macOS), you can use the `find` command to locate and delete all files except for "*.jpg":

```bash
find /path/to/directory -type f ! -name "*.jpg" -delete
```

Replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual path of the directory where you want to perform this operation.

If you're using Windows, you can use PowerShell to achieve a similar effect:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\path\to\directory" -File | Where-Object { $_.Extension -ne ".jpg" } | Remove-Item
```

Replace `"C:\path\to\directory"` with the actual path of the directory you want to work with.

Please exercise caution when using such commands, as they can result in data loss if used incorrectly. Always make sure to back up your important data before performing such operations.

It looks like you've written a unit test script for your Flask application, specifically testing the routes and functionality of the `MemMakerWdb` module. If you want to "untest" your application, you likely mean you want to stop running the tests. You can simply exit the test runner by pressing `Ctrl+C` in your terminal while the tests are running.

However, if you want to exclude or skip the tests temporarily, you have a couple of options:

1. **Comment Out the Test Code**: You can comment out the test code you don't want to run by adding `#` at the beginning of each line or by using multi-line comments (`'''` or `"""`).

   For example:
   
   ```python
   import unittest
   # from StoryMaker.app import MemMakerWdb
   # import MemMakerWdb
   class AppTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
       def setUp(self):
           self.app = app.test_client()
           self.app.testing = True
   
       def tearDown(self):
           pass
   
       # def test_index_route(self):
       #     response = self.app.get('/')
       #     self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
       #     self.assertIn(b'<h1>Welcome to StoryMaker</h1>', response.data)
   
       # def test_access_database_route(self):
       #     response = self.app.get('/access_database')
       #     self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
   
       # Add more test methods to cover other routes and functionalities
   
   if __name__ == '__main__':
       unittest.main()
   ```

2. **Use Conditional Statements**: If you want to conditionally run tests based on certain conditions, you can use `if` statements within your test methods.

   For example:

   ```python
   import unittest
   # from StoryMaker.app import MemMakerWdb
   # import MemMakerWdb
   class AppTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
       def setUp(self):
           self.app = app.test_client()
           self.app.testing = True
   
       def tearDown(self):
           pass
   
       def test_index_route(self):
           if run_test_index_route:  # Replace with your condition
               response = self.app.get('/')
               self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
               self.assertIn(b'<h1>Welcome to StoryMaker</h1>', response.data)
   
       def test_access_database_route(self):
           if run_test_access_database_route:  # Replace with your condition
               response = self.app.get('/access_database')
               self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
   
       # Add more test methods to cover other routes and functionalities
   
   if __name__ == '__main__':
       unittest.main()
   ```

Remember to replace `run_test_index_route` and `run_test_access_database_route` with your actual conditions.

Please note that proper testing is crucial for ensuring the correctness of your application. Commenting out or skipping tests should only be done temporarily and with caution.

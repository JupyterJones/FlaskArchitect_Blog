Counted paragraphs with term

matching_paragraphs = [p for p in paragraphs if search_term in p]
as it reads paragraphs i want them counted and want it to also return a cont number

Certainly, Jack. If you want to count the paragraphs as they are being read and return both the paragraph and its corresponding count number, you can achieve this by using the `enumerate` function. Here's how you can modify your code snippet to include paragraph counting:

```python
matching_paragraphs_with_count = [(count, p) for count, p in enumerate(paragraphs, start=1) if search_term in p]

for count, paragraph in matching_paragraphs_with_count:
    print(f"Paragraph {count}: {paragraph}")

# You can also log this information if you prefer
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
for count, paragraph in matching_paragraphs_with_count:
    logging.info(f"Paragraph {count}: {paragraph}")
```

This will give you a list of tuples where each tuple contains the count number of the paragraph along with the paragraph itself. You can then iterate over this list to access both the count and the paragraph. Additionally, I've provided logging functionality in case you prefer to use that for output.

the text has no format or new lines

It looks like you have an HTML template for a Flask notes application. If you want to display text without any formatting or new lines in the `<pre>` element, you can use the `word-wrap` CSS property to ensure that the text does not wrap and is displayed as a single line. Here's how you can modify your CSS to achieve this:

```css
.paragraph {
    white-space: nowrap;
    overflow: auto;
}
```

Add this CSS to your `notes_app_body.css` file, and it will prevent the text from wrapping and display it as a single line within the `<pre>` element.

Additionally, if you want to remove any additional spaces at the beginning and end of each paragraph, you can use the `strip` filter in your template like so:

```html
<div>
    <pre class="paragraph">
        {% for paragraph in text %}
           {{ paragraph|strip }}
            <br>
        {% endfor %}
    </pre>
</div>
```

This will remove any leading and trailing spaces from each paragraph before displaying them. Let me know if you need further assistance!

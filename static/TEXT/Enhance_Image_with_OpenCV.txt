Enhance Image with OpenCV

Certainly, Jack! To achieve the tasks you mentioned—increasing contrast, color enhancement, and enhancing the overall appearance of an image—you can use the `opencv-python` library. Below is a Python script that uses OpenCV to perform these operations. I've included detailed comments and logging for your convenience:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO,
                    format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

def enhance_image(input_path, output_path):
    try:
        # Read the input image
        original_image = cv2.imread(input_path)

        # Check if the image is loaded successfully
        if original_image is None:
            logging.error(f"Unable to read the image from {input_path}")
            return

        # Increase contrast using histogram equalization
        gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(original_image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
        equalized_image = cv2.equalizeHist(gray_image)

        # Color enhancement using CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)
        clahe = cv2.createCLAHE(clipLimit=2.0, tileGridSize=(8, 8))
        enhanced_image = clahe.apply(equalized_image)

        # Save the enhanced image
        cv2.imwrite(output_path, enhanced_image)

        logging.info(f"Image enhancement successful. Enhanced image saved to {output_path}")

    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"An error occurred during image enhancement: {str(e)}")

# Example usage
input_image_path = "input_image.jpg"
output_image_path = "enhanced_image.jpg"

# Call the function to enhance the image
enhance_image(input_image_path, output_image_path)
```

Replace `"input_image.jpg"` and `"enhanced_image.jpg"` with your actual file paths. This script reads an image, increases contrast using histogram equalization, and enhances color using CLAHE. The enhanced image is then saved to the specified output path.

Feel free to adjust the parameters in the code or ask if you have any specific preferences. Let me know if you need further assistance or if you'd like any modifications to the script!

i want use mogrify
ChatGPT
Certainly, Jack! If you prefer using `mogrify` from the ImageMagick suite for image manipulation, we can achieve the contrast enhancement and color enhancement with the following commands:

```bash
# Increase contrast
mogrify -contrast input_image.jpg

# Enhance color
mogrify -modulate 150,150,100 input_image.jpg
```

These commands assume you have ImageMagick installed on your Linux system. Make sure to replace `input_image.jpg` with the actual path to your input image. The `-contrast` option increases contrast, and `-modulate` adjusts brightness, saturation, and hue.

Please note that these commands modify the input image in place. If you want to keep the original image, you might want to make a copy before running these commands.

Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!

does contrast have parameters ?
ChatGPT
Yes, the `mogrify` command in ImageMagick allows you to adjust the contrast using the `-contrast` option. However, unlike some other options, it doesn't take specific parameters. The `-contrast` option simply applies a default amount of contrast enhancement to the image.

If you need more fine-grained control over the contrast adjustment, you might want to use the `-sigmoidal-contrast` option instead. This option allows you to set a contrast midpoint and a contrast factor. Here's an example:

```bash
# Fine-tune contrast with sigmoidal-contrast
mogrify -sigmoidal-contrast 3x50% input_image.jpg
```

In this example, `3x` sets the contrast factor, and `50%` sets the midpoint. You can experiment with these values to achieve the desired level of contrast.

Feel free to adjust the values and see how they affect your images. If you have specific requirements, let me know, and I can help you fine-tune the parameters for your needs!

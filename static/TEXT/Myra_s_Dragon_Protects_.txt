Sure, here's a short comic script based on your description:

---

Frame 1:
[Myra, a young woman with a determined expression, stands proudly next to her majestic dragon, which looms over her with its wings spread wide.]

Myra: Meet my faithful Dragoon!

Frame 2:
[Myra's friend, an old man with a mischievous grin, raises an eyebrow skeptically.]

Friend: Ha! Your little lizard? What's it gonna do, breathe fire on me?

Frame 3:
[The old man continues to mock Myra as she clenches her fists in frustration.]

Friend: I've seen bigger geckos!

Frame 4:
[Myra's frustration turns to anger, her eyes narrowing as she points a finger at her friend.]

Myra: Enough! You're just jealous because you don't have a Dragoon!

Frame 5:
[The old man stands his ground, crossing his arms defiantly.]

Friend: Jealous? Ha! I'll believe it when your lizard here actually does something!

Frame 6:
[Myra's dragon suddenly lunges forward, its eyes flashing with determination as it prepares to attack.]

Myra: Fine! Draco, show him what you're made of!

Frame 7:
[The old man's eyes widen in terror as he turns and starts running for his life.]

Friend: Help! Someone help me!

Frame 8:
[The old man dives behind a nearby rock, his heart racing as he peers out cautiously.]

Friend: Maybe if I stay still, it won't see me...

Frame 9:
[Meanwhile, Myra embraces her dragon, a smile spreading across her face as she strokes its scales.]

Myra: Thank you, Draco. You're the best protector a girl could ask for.

ffmpeg get the frame count of a video
ChatGPT
To get the frame count of a video using ffmpeg, you can use the following command:

```
ffmpeg -i input_video.mp4 -vframes 1 -f null -
```

This command will output information about the input video, including the frame count, to the console.

The `-i` option specifies the input video file, and the `-vframes` option tells ffmpeg to only process a single frame. The `-f null -` option is used to discard the output from the command and avoid writing it to a file.

After running this command, you should see output similar to the following:

```
Input #0, mov,mp4,m4a,3gp,3g2,mj2, from 'input_video.mp4':
  Duration: 00:01:23.45, start: 0.000000, bitrate: 128 kb/s
    Stream #0:0(und): Video: h264 (High) (avc1 / 0x31637661), yuv420p(tv, bt709), 1280x720 [SAR 1:1 DAR 16:9], 25 fps, 25 tbr, 25k tbn, 50 tbc (default)

frame=    1 fps=0.0 q=-0.0 Lsize=N/A time=00:00:00.04 bitrate=N/A speed=0.452x
```

In this output, the `frame=` line shows the number of frames in the video. In this case, there is only one frame because we used the `-vframes 1` option. If you remove that option, ffmpeg will process all frames in the video and the `frame=` line will show the total number of frames.

The output you provided is the console output of running ffmpeg command to get information about a video file. Here is a brief explanation of each section:

- `Input`: This section describes the input video file and provides some metadata about it, including its duration, bitrate, and video codec. In this example, the video is an MP4 file with H.264 video codec.

- `Stream`: This section describes the video and audio streams in the input file. In this example, there is only one video stream, identified by `Stream #0:0(und)`. The video stream uses H.264 video codec, has a resolution of 1024x1024 pixels, and a frame rate of 25 fps.

- `Stream mapping`: This section shows how the input video stream is mapped to the output. In this case, the input video stream is mapped to an output stream of type `wrapped_avframe`.

- `Output`: This section provides information about the output file. In this case, the output file is null, meaning that ffmpeg is not actually writing a file to disk. Instead, it is piping the output to the console.

- `frame`: This line shows the progress of the command as it processes the video frames. In this example, ffmpeg processed 47 frames and took 1.88 seconds to complete the operation.

Overall, this output provides information about the input video file and confirms that ffmpeg was able to successfully process the video stream.

how many frames does it have ?
ChatGPT
From the output you provided, it appears that the input video has 47 frames:

```
frame=   47 fps=0.0 q=-0.0 Lsize=N/A time=00:00:01.88 bitrate=N/A speed=6.25x
```

The `frame=` section shows that ffmpeg processed 47 frames in total.
user
how many frames per second
ChatGPT
The input video has a frame rate of 25 frames per second, as shown in the `Stream #0:0` section of the console output:

```
Stream #0:0(und): Video: h264 (Main) (avc1 / 0x31637661), yuv420p(tv, bt709), 1024x1024 [SAR 1:1 DAR 1:1], 7586 kb/s, 25 fps, 25 tbr, 90k tbn, 180k tbc (default)
```

The `25 fps` value indicates that the video has a constant frame rate of 25 frames per second.
user
how can I convert to images
ChatGPT
To convert a video to images using ffmpeg, you can use the `image2` output format and specify the desired output file format and naming convention.

Here is an example command that converts a video to a sequence of JPEG images with the file name format `output_%04d.jpg`:

```
ffmpeg -i input_video.mp4 output_%04d.jpg
```

This command will create a series of JPEG images in the current directory, starting with `output_0001.jpg`, `output_0002.jpg`, and so on, for each frame of the input video. You can modify the file name format to match your specific requirements.

If you want to extract only a specific segment of the video, you can use the `-ss` and `-t` options to specify the start time and duration of the segment, respectively. For example, the following command extracts frames from the video starting at 5 seconds and for a duration of 10 seconds:

```
ffmpeg -ss 00:00:05 -i input_video.mp4 -t 00:00:10 output_%04d.jpg
```

This command will extract frames from 5 seconds to 15 seconds of the input video and save them as JPEG images with the file name format `output_%04d.jpg`.

I got 47 images now.. how do I reassemble in an identicsl tye of vide wit ffmpeg
ChatGPT
To reassemble a sequence of images into a video using ffmpeg, you can use the `image2` input format and specify the desired output video format and codec.

Here is an example command that reassembles a sequence of JPEG images into an MP4 video:

```
ffmpeg -framerate 25 -i input_%04d.jpg -c:v libx264 -profile:v high -crf 20 -pix_fmt yuv420p output_video.mp4
```

This command assumes that the JPEG images are named as `input_0001.jpg`, `input_0002.jpg`, and so on, and that they are located in the current directory. You can modify the file name format and directory path to match your specific requirements.

The `-framerate` option specifies the frame rate of the output video, which should match the frame rate of the input images. In this example, the frame rate is set to 25 frames per second.

The `-c:v` option specifies the video codec to use for the output video, which in this case is `libx264`. The `-profile:v` and `-crf` options specify the video encoding settings, which determine the video quality and file size. The `-pix_fmt` option specifies the pixel format of the output video, which should be set to `yuv420p` for compatibility with most video players and devices.

The output video will be saved as `output_video.mp4` in the current directory. You can modify the output file name and format to match your specific requirements.

How do I do the exact same video using moviepy
ChatGPT
You can use Moviepy to create a video from a sequence of images using the following steps:

1. Import the necessary modules:

```python
from moviepy.editor import ImageSequenceClip
```

2. Create an `ImageSequenceClip` object from the sequence of images:

```python
clip = ImageSequenceClip('path/to/images', fps=25)
```

This assumes that the images are stored in a directory named `'path/to/images'`, and that they are named as `input_0001.jpg`, `input_0002.jpg`, etc.

3. Write the clip to a video file using the `write_videofile` method:

```python
clip.write_videofile('output_video.mp4', codec='libx264', fps=25)
```

This will write the clip to a file named `'output_video.mp4'` using the `libx264` codec and a frame rate of 25 frames per second.

Here is the complete code:

```python
from moviepy.editor import ImageSequenceClip

clip = ImageSequenceClip('path/to/images', fps=25)
clip.write_videofile('output_video.mp4', codec='libx264', fps=25)
```

You can adjust the codec and other encoding settings as needed to achieve the desired video quality and file size.
user
all in one script 
ChatGPT
Here's an example script that combines the image conversion with Moviepy video creation:

```python
import os
from moviepy.editor import ImageSequenceClip

# Set input/output file names and paths
input_video = 'input_video.mp4'
output_video = 'output_video.mp4'
output_images_dir = 'output_images'
fps = 25

# Create output directory for images
os.makedirs(output_images_dir, exist_ok=True)

# Use FFMPEG to extract frames from input video
os.system(f'ffmpeg -i {input_video} -vf fps={fps} {output_images_dir}/input_%04d.jpg')

# Create ImageSequenceClip object from images
clip = ImageSequenceClip(output_images_dir, fps=fps)

# Write video file using Moviepy
clip.write_videofile(output_video, codec='libx264', fps=fps)

# Cleanup: delete extracted images
os.system(f'rm -rf {output_images_dir}')
```

This script first extracts the frames from the input video using FFMPEG, saves them as JPEG images in the `output_images_dir` directory, creates an `ImageSequenceClip` object from the images, and writes the resulting video using Moviepy. Finally, the extracted images are deleted to clean up the output directory.

You can adjust the input/output file names and paths, as well as the encoding settings, as needed for your specific use case.
user
make a video same specs using image_list=random.sample(glob.glob("output_images/*.jpg),47)
ChatGPT
Sure, here's an example script that creates a video using a randomly selected subset of 47 images from the `output_images` directory:

```python
import os
import random
import glob
from moviepy.editor import ImageSequenceClip

# Set input/output file names and paths
input_video = 'input_video.mp4'
output_video = 'output_video.mp4'
output_images_dir = 'output_images'
fps = 25

# Create output directory for images
os.makedirs(output_images_dir, exist_ok=True)

# Use FFMPEG to extract frames from input video
os.system(f'ffmpeg -i {input_video} -vf fps={fps} {output_images_dir}/input_%04d.jpg')

# Select a random subset of images
image_list = random.sample(glob.glob(f"{output_images_dir}/*.jpg"), 47)

# Create ImageSequenceClip object from selected images
clip = ImageSequenceClip(image_list, fps=fps)

# Write video file using Moviepy
clip.write_videofile(output_video, codec='libx264', fps=fps)

# Cleanup: delete extracted images
os.system(f'rm -rf {output_images_dir}')
```

This script works similarly to the previous one, but selects a random subset of 47 images from the `output_images` directory using the `random.sample` function and passes this list to the `ImageSequenceClip` constructor. The resulting video has the same specifications (frame rate, resolution, etc.) as the input video, since we're not explicitly changing any of these settings.
user
can decimate allow 3 of the same frames only
ChatGPT
Yes, you can use the `decimate` filter in ffmpeg to keep only one out of every three frames. This can be achieved by setting the `nth` parameter to 3.

However, if you want to keep only three frames that are repeated throughout the video, you can use the `select` filter to explicitly select the frames you want to keep.

Here's an example command that selects the frames at 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9 seconds and creates a video with only those frames:

```
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -filter_complex "[0:v]select='eq(t,0.1)+eq(t,0.5)+eq(t,0.9)',setpts=N/FRAME_RATE/TB" -an output.mp4
```

In this command, the `select` filter is used to select the frames at 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9 seconds. The `setpts` filter is used to set the timestamps of the selected frames to a constant value, so that they appear in the output video as three identical frames.

You can modify this command to select any other frames you want by changing the values of the `eq` functions inside the `select` filter.
user
use decimate
ChatGPT
To use `decimate` filter to keep only one out of every three frames in a video, you can use the following command:

```
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "decimate=3" -an output.mp4
```

In this command, the `decimate` filter is applied to the input video, and the `nth` parameter is set to 3, which means that only one out of every three frames will be kept. The resulting video will have a lower frame rate than the original video.

You can adjust the `nth` parameter to keep a different number of frames per group. For example, to keep one out of every four frames, you can set `nth=4`.
user
one out of three Identical frames do nothing with the changing frames
ChatGPT
To keep only one out of every three identical frames while preserving all the changing frames, you can use the `mpdecimate` filter in FFmpeg. The `mpdecimate` filter is specifically designed to remove duplicate frames from videos while preserving the changing frames.

Here's an example command that uses `mpdecimate` to remove identical frames and keep only one out of every three:

```
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "mpdecimate,setpts=N/FRAME_RATE/TB" -an output.mp4
```

In this command, the `mpdecimate` filter is applied to the input video, which will remove identical frames while preserving all the frames that are different. The `setpts` filter is used to adjust the timestamps of the remaining frames to ensure that they are displayed at the correct speed.

The resulting video will have a lower frame rate than the original video, and will only contain one out of every three identical frames.
user
DOes that actualal ydetect the difference or only use time ?
ChatGPT
The `mpdecimate` filter in FFmpeg uses only time to detect identical frames. It does not perform any visual analysis to detect differences between frames.

The `mpdecimate` filter works by comparing the timestamp (timecode) of each frame with the previous frame. If the difference between the timestamps is less than a specified threshold, the filter considers the frames to be identical and discards the current frame. If the difference is greater than the threshold, the filter considers the frames to be different and keeps the current frame.

So, in essence, `mpdecimate` is a time-based filter that removes identical frames based on their timestamps, rather than their visual content. If your video contains frames that are visually identical but have different timestamps, `mpdecimate` will not remove those frames.
user
is there an ffmpeg  tool that detects the changes 
ChatGPT
Yes, FFmpeg provides several filters for detecting changes between frames in a video. Here are a few examples:

1. `frei0r=diff0r`: This filter computes the difference between two consecutive frames and outputs the result as a grayscale image. Pixels with higher values indicate greater differences between the frames.

2. `frei0r=glow": This filter calculates the amount of "glow" in the video, which is the average amount of change between frames.

3. `select=gt(scene\,0.4)`: This filter detects scene changes by looking for frames where the difference between the current frame and the previous frame is greater than a specified threshold.

4. `blend=all_mode=difference`: This filter calculates the difference between two frames and outputs the result as an image. The resulting image will be black for frames that are identical, and white for frames that are completely different.

Note that these filters can be quite resource-intensive and may slow down the encoding process. It's a good idea to test them on a small portion of your video before running them on the entire file.
user
may I see an example of both 
ChatGPT
Sure! Here are examples of how to use the `frei0r=diff0r` and `select=gt(scene\,0.4)` filters in FFmpeg:

1. `frei0r=diff0r` example:

```
ffmpeg -i input_video.mp4 -vf frei0r=diff0r -pix_fmt gray output_diff.mp4
```

This command takes `input_video.mp4`, applies the `frei0r=diff0r` filter, and outputs the result as a grayscale video named `output_diff.mp4`. The resulting video will show the difference between consecutive frames as grayscale images.

2. `select=gt(scene\,0.4)` example:

```
ffmpeg -i input_video.mp4 -vf "select=gt(scene\,0.4),setpts=N/FRAME_RATE/TB" -af "aselect=gt(scene\,0.4),asetpts=N/SR/TB" output_scenes.mp4
```

This command uses the `select` filter to detect scene changes in `input_video.mp4` where the difference between consecutive frames is greater than 0.4. The resulting video will include only the scenes that meet this criteria. The `setpts` and `asetpts` filters are used to correct the timestamps of the video and audio streams, respectively, to avoid glitches in the output video. The resulting video is saved as `output_scenes.mp4`.

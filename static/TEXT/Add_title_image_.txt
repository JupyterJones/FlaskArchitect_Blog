To add a title image before the video starts, you can use the `ImageClip` class from moviepy library. Here's how you can modify your code to add the title image:

```
import os
import random
from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip, CompositeVideoClip, concatenate_videoclips, ImageClip, vfx

# Set the duration of the transition in seconds
transition_duration = 2

# Get a list of all the .mp4 files in the current directory
mp4_files = [f for f in os.listdir('.') if os.path.isfile(f) and f.endswith('short.mp4')]

# Choose 10 random files from the list
selected_files = random.sample(mp4_files, 15)

# Load the title image as an ImageClip object and set its duration
title_image = ImageClip("Title.png").set_duration(2)

# Load each selected file as a VideoFileClip object and add a transition
clips = [title_image]
for i, file in enumerate(selected_files):
    clip = VideoFileClip(file)
    if i > 0:
        transition_duration = min(transition_duration, clip.duration)
        transition = CompositeVideoClip([clips[-1].set_end(clips[-1].duration-transition_duration),
                                         clip.set_start(transition_duration)])
        clips.append(transition)
    clips.append(clip)

# Concatenate the clips into one video
final_clip = concatenate_videoclips(clips)

# Write the final video to a file
final_clip.write_videofile("Short_out_01.mp4")
```

In the above code, I added the following lines:

```
# Load the title image as an ImageClip object and set its duration
title_image = ImageClip("Title.png").set_duration(2)
```

This loads the `Title.png` image and sets its duration to 2 seconds.

```
clips = [title_image]
```

This adds the title image clip to the beginning of the `clips` list.

```
final_clip = concatenate_videoclips(clips)
```

This concatenates all the clips in the `clips` list, including the title image, into one final clip.

Note that I also imported the `ImageClip` class and the `vfx` module from the moviepy library. The `vfx` module is used to add transitions between the video clips.

Vertical Webcam Livestream: ffmpeg.

ffmpeg rotate cam for vertical livestream
ChatGPT
To rotate a webcam feed for a vertical livestream using ffmpeg, you can use the `transpose` filter. Here's a complete script that rotates the webcam feed by 90 degrees clockwise and streams it vertically:

```python
import subprocess
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

def rotate_webcam_for_vertical_live_stream():
    try:
        # Command to capture webcam feed and rotate it
        cmd = [
            'ffmpeg',
            '-f', 'v4l2',                    # Input format (webcam)
            '-video_size', '640x480',        # Video size
            '-i', '/dev/video0',             # Input device (webcam)
            '-vf', 'transpose=1',            # Rotate 90 degrees clockwise
            '-c:v', 'libx264',               # Video codec
            '-pix_fmt', 'yuv420p',           # Pixel format
            '-preset', 'ultrafast',          # Preset for speed
            '-tune', 'zerolatency',          # Tune for zero latency
            '-f', 'flv',                     # Output format (FLV for streaming)
            'rtmp://your-streaming-server-url/your-stream-key'  # Replace with your streaming server URL and stream key
        ]

        logging.info("Starting webcam rotation for vertical livestream...")
        # Start ffmpeg process
        subprocess.run(cmd, check=True)

    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        logging.error(f"Error: {e}")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    rotate_webcam_for_vertical_live_stream()
```

Replace `'rtmp://your-streaming-server-url/your-stream-key'` with the appropriate RTMP URL for your streaming server and stream key.

This script captures the webcam feed, rotates it 90 degrees clockwise using the `transpose` filter, and then streams it vertically using RTMP protocol. Make sure you have ffmpeg installed and configured properly on your system.

bash terminal command

Sure, if you prefer to run the command directly in the terminal, you can use the following command:

```bash
ffmpeg -f v4l2 -video_size 640x480 -i /dev/video0 -vf transpose=1 -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p -preset ultrafast -tune zerolatency -f flv rtmp://your-streaming-server-url/your-stream-key
```

Replace `'rtmp://your-streaming-server-url/your-stream-key'` with the appropriate RTMP URL for your streaming server and stream key.

This command does the same thing as the Python script: it captures the webcam feed, rotates it 90 degrees clockwise using the `transpose` filter, and then streams it vertically using RTMP protocol. Make sure you have ffmpeg installed and configured properly on your system.

rotate a capture
ffmpeg -f x11grab -video_size 1360x768 -framerate 24 -i :0.0 -f alsa -i default -preset veryfast -crf 18 -pix_fmt yuv420p -t 20

To rotate a screen capture with ffmpeg, you can use the `transpose` filter in a similar way as we did with the webcam feed. Here's the modified command to rotate the screen capture 90 degrees clockwise:

```bash
ffmpeg -f x11grab -video_size 1360x768 -framerate 24 -i :0.0 -f alsa -i default -vf transpose=1 -preset veryfast -crf 18 -pix_fmt yuv420p -t 20 output.mp4
```

In this command:

- `-vf transpose=1` applies a 90-degree clockwise rotation to the video.
- `-t 20` specifies the duration of the captured video to be 20 seconds. You can adjust this as needed.
- `output.mp4` is the output file name. You can change it to whatever you like.

Make sure to replace `output.mp4` with your desired output file name. This command captures the screen, rotates the video 90 degrees clockwise, and saves it as an MP4 file with the specified parameters.

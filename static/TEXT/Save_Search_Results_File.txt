---------------------------------  this works great
i would like to also save the results to a file.
filename:
{row_id}_+ 'the unique words found separated by underscore'+ .txt

To enhance your script by saving the results to a file, we need to modify the `search_db` function to include this feature. Below is the updated script that does exactly that:

```python
import sqlite3
from sys import argv

def search_db(search_term):
    # Connect to the database
    conn = sqlite3.connect('/home/jack/Desktop/FlaskBlog/instance/blog3.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    # Split the input search term into individual words
    search_terms = set(search_term.lower().split())

    # Construct the WHERE clause for the SQL query to filter rows based on any of the search terms
    where_conditions = []
    for term in search_terms:
        where_conditions.append("content LIKE ?")
    
    where_clause = " OR ".join(where_conditions)
    query = f"SELECT ROWID, content FROM post WHERE {where_clause}"

    # Execute the SELECT query with the constructed WHERE clause
    rows = cursor.execute(query, ['%' + term + '%' for term in search_terms])

    best_match = None
    max_unique_count = 0

    # Iterate over the resulting rows
    for row in rows:
        row_id, content = row
        content_words = set(content.lower().split())
        unique_count = len(search_terms & content_words)
        
        if unique_count > max_unique_count:
            max_unique_count = unique_count
            best_match = (row_id, content, unique_count)

    conn.close()

    if best_match:
        row_id, content, unique_count = best_match
        unique_words = '_'.join(search_terms & set(content.lower().split()))
        filename = f"{row_id}_{unique_words}.txt"

        with open(filename, 'w') as file:
            file.write(f"ROWID: {row_id}\nContent:\n{content}\nUnique matches: {unique_count}\n")

        return [f"Results saved to {filename}", f"ROWID: {row_id}\nContent:\n{content}\nUnique matches: {unique_count}"]
    else:
        return ["No results found."]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    if len(argv) < 2:
        print("Please provide a search term.")
    else:
        search_term = argv[1]
        results = search_db(search_term)
        for result in results:
            print(result)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Connection to Database**: The script connects to your SQLite database as before.
2. **Query Construction**: The search term is split into individual words and a SQL query is constructed to search for these terms in the `content` field of the `post` table.
3. **Executing the Query**: The script executes the query and processes the results to find the best match based on the number of unique search terms found in the content.
4. **Saving Results to a File**:
   - If a match is found, the unique words are joined with underscores (`_`) to form part of the filename.
   - The results are saved in a text file named with the format `{row_id}_{unique_words}.txt`.
   - The results are also printed to the console.

### Usage:
1. Save the script to a Python file, e.g., `search_save.py`.
2. Run the script from the command line with a search term:
   ```sh
   python search_save.py "your search term"
   ```

The results will be printed to the console and also saved to a text file in the current directory.

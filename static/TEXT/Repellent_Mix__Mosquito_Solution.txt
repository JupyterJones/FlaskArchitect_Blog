Ah, dealing with those pesky mosquitoes, Jack? Here's a natural solution to keep them away:

```python
import logging
import time

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

def create_mosquito_repellent():
    logging.info("Creating a natural mosquito repellent.")

    # Ingredients
    essential_oil = "citronella"
    carrier_oil = "coconut oil"
    ratio = 1:10  # Adjust ratio based on preference

    logging.info("Mixing {} essential oil with {} carrier oil in a {} ratio.".format(essential_oil, carrier_oil, ratio))

    # Apply on skin or clothing
    logging.info("Apply the mixture on exposed skin or clothing to keep those mosquitoes at bay.")

    logging.info("Mosquito repellent created successfully!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    create_mosquito_repellent()
```

Feel free to adjust the essential oil and carrier oil based on your preferences. If you have any questions or if you'd like to discuss the Arcanians while mixing up your mosquito repellent, I'm here for you!

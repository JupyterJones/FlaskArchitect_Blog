Sure, Jack! I'll update your script to meet the requirements you've outlined, including detailed comments and logging for clarity.

```python
import logging
from moviepy.editor import ImageClip, concatenate_videoclips

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

# Example list of filtered images (update this with your actual list)
filtered_images = ['image1.jpg', 'image2.jpg', 'image3.jpg']

# Create a list of clips from the images with a crossfade transition
clips = []

for i in range(len(filtered_images) - 1):
    # Create the first image clip with a duration of 1 second
    clip1 = ImageClip(filtered_images[i], duration=1)
    logging.debug(f'Created clip1 from {filtered_images[i]} with duration 1 second')

    # Create the second image clip with a duration of 1.5 seconds
    clip2 = ImageClip(filtered_images[i + 1], duration=1.5)
    logging.debug(f'Created clip2 from {filtered_images[i + 1]} with duration 1.5 seconds')

    # Apply crossfade-in of 0.5 seconds to the second clip
    cross_fade = clip2.crossfadein(0.5)
    logging.debug('Applied 0.5 seconds crossfade-in to clip2')

    # Apply crossfade-out of 0.75 seconds to the first clip
    clip1_with_fadeout = clip1.crossfadeout(0.75).set_duration(1.75)
    logging.debug('Applied 0.75 seconds crossfade-out to clip1 and set duration to 1.75 seconds')

    # Append the first clip with fade-out to the list
    clips.append(clip1_with_fadeout)
    logging.debug('Appended clip1 with fade-out to clips list')

    # Append the second clip with fade-in to the list
    clips.append(cross_fade.set_duration(1.75))
    logging.debug('Appended clip2 with fade-in to clips list')

# Concatenate the clips into a single video
final_clip = concatenate_videoclips(clips)
logging.debug('Concatenated all clips into final_clip')

# You can save the final video to a file (optional)
final_clip.write_videofile("final_video.mp4", fps=24)
logging.info('Saved final video to final_video.mp4')
```

### Explanation

1. **Logging Setup**: Configured logging to debug level to capture detailed messages about the code execution.
2. **Creating Clips**: Each image is made into an `ImageClip` object with specified durations:
   - `clip1` for 1 second.
   - `clip2` for 1.5 seconds.
3. **Transitions**:
   - `clip2` has a crossfade-in transition of 0.5 seconds.
   - `clip1` has a crossfade-out transition of 0.75 seconds.
4. **Adjusting Durations**: 
   - `clip1`'s duration is set to 1.75 seconds to accommodate the crossfade-out.
   - `clip2`'s duration is set to 1.75 seconds to accommodate the crossfade-in.
5. **Appending Clips**: Clips are added to the list in the required order with transitions.
6. **Concatenation**: All clips are concatenated into a single video.
7. **Saving the Video**: The final video is saved to a file named `final_video.mp4`.

4. **Appending Clips**: Clips are added to the list in the required order with transitions.
5. **Handling Last Clip**: The last image is handled separately to ensure it's included without crossfade.
6. **Concatenation**: All clips are concatenated into a single video using the "compose" method to handle transitions properly.
7. **Saving the Video**: The final video is saved to a file named `final_video.mp4`.

### Explanation

1. **Logging Setup**: Configured logging to debug level to capture detailed messages about the code execution.
2. **Image List**: Uses `glob` to find all `.jpg` files and selects 8 randomly.
3. **Random Functions**:
   - `random_fadein`: Generates a random fade-in time between 0.5 and 1.0 seconds.
   - `random_fadeout`: Generates a random fade-out time between 0.5 and 1.0 seconds.
   - `random_duration`: Chooses a random duration for the images from 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, and 1.5 seconds.
4. **Creating Clips**:
   - Each image clip is created with a random duration.
   - Applies random fade-in and fade-out times to the clips.
5. **Appending Clips**: Clips are added to the list in the required order with transitions.
6. **Handling Last Clip**: The last image is handled separately to ensure it's included without crossfade.
7. **Concatenation**: All clips are concatenated into a single video using the "compose" method to handle transitions properly.
8. **Saving the Video**: The final video is saved to a file named `final_video2.mp4`.

Got it, Jack! Let's update the script to ensure the fade-in and fade-out times, as well as image durations, are in one decimal place increments that are human-eye perceivable.

Here's the updated script:

```python

# Function to generate random fade-out time with one decimal place

# Function to generate random image duration with specific steps

# Create a list of clips from the images with crossfade transitions

logging.info('Saved final video to final_video2.mp4')
```

### Explanation

1. **Random Functions**:
   - `random_fadein`: Generates a random fade-in time rounded to one decimal place between 0.5 and 1.0 seconds.
   - `random_fadeout`: Generates a random fade-out time rounded to one decimal place between 0.5 and 1.0 seconds.
   - `random_duration`: Chooses a random duration for the images from 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, and 1.5 seconds.
2. **Clip Creation and Transition Application**:
   - Each image clip is created with a random duration.
   - Random fade-in and fade-out times are applied to the clips, ensuring the values are perceivable by the human eye.
3. **Appending Clips**: Clips are added to the list in the required order with transitions.
4. **Handling Last Clip**: The last image is handled separately to ensure it's included without crossfade.
5. **Concatenation**: All clips are concatenated into a single video using the "compose" method to handle transitions properly.
6. **Saving the Video**: The final video is saved to a file named `final_video2.mp4`.

It seems like you're encountering a `ModuleNotFoundError` because Python couldn't find the `face_detection` module. This error occurs when Python interpreter is unable to locate the specified module in your environment.

To resolve this issue, you need to make sure that the `face_detection` module is installed in your Python environment. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so using pip, which is the package installer for Python.

Here's how you can install the `face_detection` module using pip:

```bash
pip install face_detection
```

Make sure you run this command in your terminal or command prompt. Once the installation is complete, you should be able to import the `face_detection` module without any errors.

If you've already installed the module but are still encountering this error, it's possible that there could be an issue with your Python environment or the module installation itself. In that case, you may need to troubleshoot further or reinstall the module.

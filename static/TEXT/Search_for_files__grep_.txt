Certainly, Jack! You can use the `grep` command to achieve this. Here's a one-liner bash command that will search for files containing the `#` symbol and list the filename, line number, and the line content:

```bash
grep -rHn '#' *
```

Explanation:
- `grep`: Command to search text using patterns.
- `-r`: Recursively search directories.
- `-H`: Print the filename for each match.
- `-n`: Print the line number for each match.
- `'#'`: The pattern to search for (the `#` symbol).
- `*`: Search in all files in the current directory and subdirectories.

This command will output the filename, line number, and the line containing the `#` symbol for each match found in your files.

You can use the following one-liner bash command to search for files containing the `#` symbol and list the filename, line number, the line content, and an additional newline:

```bash
grep -rHn '#' * | awk '{print $0 "\n"}'
```

Explanation:
- `grep -rHn '#' *`: As explained previously, this searches recursively for the `#` symbol and prints the filename, line number, and line content.
- `|`: Pipes the output of the `grep` command to `awk`.
- `awk '{print $0 "\n"}'`: This appends a newline after each line of the output from `grep`.

This will give you the desired output format with an additional newline after each match.

grep -rHn '#' * | awk '{print $0 "\n"}'
only the *.py
ChatGPT
To limit the search to only Python files (`*.py`), you can modify the command like this:

```bash
grep -rHn '#' --include=\*.py * | awk '{print $0 "\n"}'
```

Explanation:
- `--include=\*.py`: This option tells `grep` to include only files that match the pattern `*.py`.

This command will search for `#` in all Python files and output the filename, line number, line content, and an additional newline.

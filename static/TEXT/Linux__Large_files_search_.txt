Linux: Large files search.

linux list the 20 largest files NOT directories in ~/Desktop sorted
ChatGPT
To list the 20 largest files (not directories) in the `~/Desktop` directory sorted by size, you can use the following command in the terminal:

```
find ~/Desktop -maxdepth 1 -type f -printf '%s %p\n' | sort -nr | head -20
```

Here's what each part of the command does:

- `find ~/Desktop -maxdepth 1 -type f -printf '%s %p\n'`: This command finds all files (`-type f`) in the `~/Desktop` directory (`-maxdepth 1`) and prints the size of each file in bytes (`%s`) and the file name with its path (`%p`) separated by a space, followed by a newline character. 
- `sort -nr`: This command sorts the list of files in descending order (`-r`) by size (`-n`).
- `head -20`: This command displays the first 20 files in the sorted list.

Note that the `~` symbol represents the user's home directory. You can replace `~/Desktop` with the path to any directory to find the largest files in that directory.

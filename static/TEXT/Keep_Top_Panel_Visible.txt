In most desktop environments for Linux, the behavior of the top panel (also known as the taskbar or panel) when in full-screen mode can vary. However, you can often configure this behavior to suit your preferences. Here's how you can achieve this in a few popular desktop environments:

### GNOME:

1. **Open GNOME Tweaks**: Install GNOME Tweaks if you haven't already, and open it.

2. **Go to Extensions**: Look for an extension called "Autohide Top Bar" and disable it. This should keep the top panel visible even in full-screen mode.

### KDE Plasma:

1. **Open System Settings**: Go to your system settings.

2. **Configure Panel**: Navigate to the "Panel" section or search for it in the settings. Look for an option related to auto-hiding or behavior in full-screen mode.

3. **Disable Auto-hide**: If there's an option to auto-hide the panel in full-screen mode, disable it.

### Cinnamon (default in Linux Mint):

1. **Right-click on the Panel**: Right-click on the panel at the top.

2. **Panel Settings**: Select "Panel Settings" or similar option.

3. **Behavior**: Look for an option related to auto-hiding or behavior in full-screen mode, and disable it.

### Xfce:

1. **Right-click on the Panel**: Right-click on the panel at the top.

2. **Panel Preferences**: Select "Panel Preferences" or similar option.

3. **Behavior**: Look for an option related to auto-hiding or behavior in full-screen mode, and disable it.

### Unity (default in older versions of Ubuntu):

1. **Launch System Settings**: Click on the system settings icon in the top-right corner.

2. **Appearance Settings**: Go to the appearance settings.

3. **Behavior Tab**: Look for an option related to the behavior of the top panel in full-screen mode.

4. **Disable Auto-hide**: If there's an option to auto-hide the panel in full-screen mode, disable it.

These instructions should help you keep the top panel visible even when in full-screen mode. If you encounter any issues or if your desktop environment is different, let me know, and I can provide further assistance.

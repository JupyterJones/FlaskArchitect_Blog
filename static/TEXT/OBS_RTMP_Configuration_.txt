2. Under "Settings," click on the "Stream" tab located on the left-hand side.

3. Select "Custom Streaming Server" under the "Service" drop-down menu.

4. In the "Server" field, enter the RTMP URL provided by your streaming platform or service.

5. In the "Stream key" field, enter the stream key provided by your streaming platform or service.

Copy File with Timestamp

It looks like you're trying to create a bash script that copies a file to a specific directory with a timestamp in the filename. Let me provide a corrected version of your script with some logging added for clarity:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get the current date and time
timestamp=$(date +%m-%d-%Y-%N)

# Log the timestamp
echo "Timestamp: $timestamp"

# Check if the input file exists
if [ -f "$1" ]; then
    # Define the destination directory
    destination="/mnt/HDD500/Image_Retriever/static/videos/"

    # Construct the new filename with the timestamp
    new_filename="Archive_${timestamp}_$(basename "$1")"

    # Log the new filename
    echo "New filename: $new_filename"

    # Copy the file to the destination directory with the new filename
    cp "$1" "$destination$new_filename"

    # Log the path to the copied file
    copied_file_path="$destination$new_filename"
    echo "Copied file path: $copied_file_path"

    # Output the copied file path
    echo "$copied_file_path"
else
    # Log an error if the input file does not exist
    echo "Error: Input file does not exist."
    exit 1
fi
```

This script first retrieves the current timestamp, then checks if the input file exists. If it does, it constructs a new filename using the timestamp and copies the file to the specified destination directory with the new filename. Finally, it logs the path to the copied file and outputs it. If the input file does not exist, it logs an error message.

bash if not exist mkdir temp 
ChatGPT
Certainly, Jack! If you want to create a directory named "temp" in Bash only if it doesn't already exist, you can use the following command:

```bash
if [ ! -d "temp" ]; then
    mkdir temp
fi
```

This script checks if the directory "temp" doesn't exist (`[ ! -d "temp" ]`) and if that condition is true, it creates the directory using `mkdir temp`.

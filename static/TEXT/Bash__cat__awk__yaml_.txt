Explain what this bash command does: "cat config.yaml | awk NF"
ChatGPT
This bash command `cat config.yaml | awk NF` does the following:

1. `cat config.yaml`: This part of the command reads the content of the file named `config.yaml` and outputs it to the standard output (stdout). `cat` is a command used to concatenate and display the content of files.

2. `|`: This symbol, known as the pipe, takes the output of the command on its left side and passes it as input to the command on its right side.

3. `awk NF`: This part of the command uses the `awk` command-line utility. `awk` is a powerful text processing tool that scans and processes text files. In this case, `NF` is a built-in variable in `awk` that represents the number of fields in a record. By default, `awk` considers a record to be a line of text, and a field to be a string of characters separated by whitespace (spaces or tabs).

   So, `awk NF` effectively filters out empty lines from the output of `cat config.yaml`. When `awk` encounters a line with no fields (i.e., an empty line), it does not output anything for that line. Therefore, the command effectively outputs only the non-empty lines of the `config.yaml` file.

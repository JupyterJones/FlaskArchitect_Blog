ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pttsx3'

ChatGPT
It seems you're encountering a "ModuleNotFoundError" for the 'pttsx3' module. It looks like you might be trying to use a text-to-speech library. However, it appears that there might be a typo in the module name. The correct module is 'pyttsx3' rather than 'pttsx3'. 

To resolve this issue, you need to install 'pyttsx3' in your Python environment. You can do this using pip, which is already in your list of installed packages. Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
pip install pyttsx3
```

This command will install the 'pyttsx3' module, and you should be able to use it in your Python projects once it's installed. If you face any issues during the installation or need further assistance, please let me know, and I'll be happy to help.

import pyttsx3
engine = pyttsx3.init()
engine.setProperty('rate',100)
voices = engine.getProperty('voice')
engine.setProperty('voice',voices{0}.id)
engine.say("This is a woman's voice")

engine.runAndWait()    error
ChatGPT
I see that you're trying to use the 'pyttsx3' library for text-to-speech. The error you're encountering is due to a small syntax issue in the line where you're trying to set the voice. The correct syntax should be:

```python
engine.setProperty('voice', voices[0].id)
```

Here's your corrected code:

```python
import pyttsx3

engine = pyttsx3.init()
engine.setProperty('rate', 100)

# Get the list of available voices
voices = engine.getProperty('voices')

# Set the first voice (0) in the list
engine.setProperty('voice', voices[0].id)

engine.say("This is a woman's voice")
engine.runAndWait()
```

By using `voices[0].id`, you'll correctly select the first voice in the list of available voices. This should resolve the error, and your code should work as expected with a woman's voice. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.

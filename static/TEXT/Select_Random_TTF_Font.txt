It looks like you're trying to create a function named `pick` that selects a random TrueType Font (TTF) file from a specified directory. However, the code snippet you provided is incomplete, and it seems like there might be a missing part.

To help you more effectively, could you provide the specific requirements or functionality you want for this function? Additionally, if there are any issues or errors you've encountered, please let me know so I can address them in the corrected script.

I only want files that ends with *.ttf

Certainly! Here's the complete script for the `pick` function that selects a random TrueType Font (TTF) file from a specified directory, considering only files that end with *.ttf:

```python
import os
import random
import logging

def pick(font_path):
    try:
        # Get a list of all files in the font_path directory that end with *.ttf
        ttf_files = [x for x in os.listdir(font_path) if x.endswith('.ttf') and os.path.isfile(os.path.join(font_path, x))]

        # Check if there are any TTF files in the directory
        if not ttf_files:
            logging.error(f"No TrueType Font (TTF) files found in the directory: {font_path}")
            return None

        # Choose a random TTF file from the list
        selected_font = random.choice(ttf_files)

        # Log the selected font
        logging.info(f"Selected TrueType Font (TTF): {selected_font}")

        # Return the full path to the selected font
        return os.path.join(font_path, selected_font)

    except Exception as e:
        # Log any exceptions that occur
        logging.exception(f"An error occurred in the pick function: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage:
font_directory = "/path/to/your/fonts"
selected_font_path = pick(font_directory)

# Check if a font was successfully selected
if selected_font_path:
    print(f"Selected font path: {selected_font_path}")
else:
    print("Failed to select a font.")
```

This script includes logging to capture information about the font selection process and any potential errors. Feel free to adjust the `font_directory` variable to the path where your TTF files are located. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!

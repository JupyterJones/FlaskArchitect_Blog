        padding: 10px;
        text-align: center !important;

how do i prevent the text in a textarea from inheriting 'center'

To prevent the text in a textarea from inheriting the 'center' alignment from its parent element, you can specifically target the textarea element and override the text-align property. Here's how you can do it:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    html {
      padding: 10px;
      text-align: center !important;
    }
    /* Target the textarea element and set its text alignment to left */
    textarea {
      text-align: left;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <textarea rows="4" cols="50">
    This is a textarea with text that won't be centered.
  </textarea>
</body>
</html>
```

In this code, we've added a CSS rule specifically targeting the textarea element and setting its text-align property to 'left'. This overrides any inherited text alignment from its parent element, ensuring that the text inside the textarea won't be centered.

my style.css is:
static/css/style.css
how do i load that in my template html files
ChatGPT
To load your `style.css` file in your template HTML files, you can use the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section of your HTML files. Here's how you can do it:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <!-- Link to your style.css file -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/static/css/style.css">
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Your HTML content goes here -->
</body>
</html>
```

In the `<link>` tag, the `href` attribute should point to the path where your `style.css` file is located relative to the root directory of your web server. If your `style.css` file is located in the `static/css` directory relative to the root directory, then you would use `/static/css/style.css` as shown in the example.

Make sure to adjust the path (`href`) accordingly if your `style.css` file is located in a different directory or if your static files are served from a different route. This will ensure that your CSS styles are properly applied to your HTML templates.

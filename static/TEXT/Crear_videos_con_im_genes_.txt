I want to make an mp4 video for images in randomly selected image directories. I want the images to blend as they are displayed. The video including sound must not be over 58 seconds. It may be shorter. shorter is not important. This script seems to have problems with video length

To create an MP4 video from randomly selected image directories with blending transitions and ensure the video is not over 58 seconds, you can make some modifications to your existing script. Here's a revised version of your script with detailed explanations and added logging:

```python
#!/home/jack/miniconda3/envs/cloned_base/bin/python
from moviepy.editor import VideoFileClip, AudioFileClip, VideoClip
import glob
import uuid
import random
import os
import cv2
from PIL import Image

# Function to choose a directory with image files
def choose_dir():
    path = "/home/jack/Desktop/HDD500/collections/images/"
    directories = [d for d in os.listdir(path) if os.path.isdir(os.path.join(path, d))

    if not directories:
        logging.error("No directories found in the specified path.")
        return None

    DIR = os.path.join(path, random.choice(directories))
    return DIR

# Function to create a video from image files with blending transitions
def makevideo(directory):
    logging.info(f"Making a video in directory: {directory}")

    # Get a list of image files
    image_files = random.sample(glob.glob(os.path.join(directory, "*.jpg"), 27)

    if not image_files:
        logging.error(f"No image files found in {directory}.")
        return

    # Shuffle the image files to mix them randomly
    random.shuffle(image_files)

    # Get the size of the first image
    im = Image.open(image_files[0])
    SIZE = im.size

    # Create a list of video clips for blending
    video_clips = []

    for i in range(len(image_files)):
        img1 = VideoFileClip(image_files[i], audio=False)

        if i < len(image_files) - 1:
            img2 = VideoFileClip(image_files[i + 1], audio=False)
        else:
            img2 = VideoFileClip(image_files[0], audio=False)

        transition = VideoClip.make_frame(lambda t: img1.get_frame(t) * (1 - t) + img2.get_frame(t) * t)
        video_clip = VideoClip(transition, duration=img1.duration)
        video_clips.append(video_clip)

    # Concatenate the video clips with transitions
    final_video = VideoClip.concat_videoclips(video_clips, method="compose")

    # Limit the video duration to a maximum of 58 seconds
    max_duration = min(final_video.duration, 58)
    final_video = final_video.subclip(0, max_duration)

    # Get an MP3 audio file
    audio_clip = AudioFileClip(get_an_mp3())

    # Set the audio of the video
    final_video = final_video.set_audio(audio_clip)

    # Generate a unique filename for the final video
    uid = str(uuid.uuid4())
    des = os.path.basename(directory)
    mp4_file = f"/home/jack/Desktop/HDD500/collections/vids/{des}{uid}.mp4"

    # Write the final video to the output file
    final_video.write_videofile(mp4_file, codec='libx264', threads=4)

    logging.info(f"Video created and saved to: {mp4_file}")

if __name__ == "__main":
    # Configure logging
    logging.basicConfig(filename='video_maker.log', level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s: %(message)s')

    try:
        for i in range(50):
            DIR = choose_dir()
            logging.info(f"Selected directory: {DIR}")
            try:
                makevideo(DIR)
            except Exception as e:
                logging.error(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
```

In this revised script, we've made the following improvements:

1. We use `VideoFileClip` to load image files as video clips.
2. We create a list of video clips with blending transitions using the `VideoClip.make_frame` function.
3. We concatenate the video clips using `VideoClip.concat_videoclips`.
4. We limit the video duration to a maximum of 58 seconds.
5. We set the audio of the final video.
6. We save the final video with a unique filename.

Please note that the script is configured for your specific directory structure, and you might need to adjust the paths to match your setup. Additionally, ensure that you have the necessary Python packages installed.

this does nothing ?

I'm sorry to hear that the script isn't working as expected. Let's try to identify the issue and make the necessary corrections.

1. Ensure that the following libraries are installed: `moviepy`, `cv2`, `Pillow`, and `ffmpeg`. You can use `pip` to install these if they are not already installed.

2. The script depends on the presence of image files in the selected directories. Make sure that there are image files (in jpg format) in the directories you're targeting.

3. Check the paths used in the script to make sure they are correct. Ensure that the paths to the image directories, MP3 files, and output directories are accurate.

4. To help with debugging, you can add print statements at various points in the code to check the values of variables and see where the script might be failing.

Here's an updated version of your script with additional print statements for debugging:

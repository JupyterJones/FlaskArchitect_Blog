   Python's where the magic shines.
   AI models, they come alive,
   Making videos, we thrive.

   Python AI, let's reach the sky!

2. **Code Composer's Anthem**:
   (Verse 1)
   With keystrokes as my notes,
   And libraries as my quotes,
   I compose a symphony so grand,
   AI videos, at my command.

   (Chorus)
   Python strings and melodies,
   Weaving tales of AIs, if you please.
   From concept to reality, we glide,
   In the world of Python, we confide.

3. **AI Serenade**:

   In the realm of ones and zeros,
   Python's where our creativity flows.

   Let's dance in the pixels, oh so fine,
   Python's rhythm, like aged wine.
   From scripts to screens, we serenade,
   AI videos, our accolade.

4. **The Python AI Jive**:
   (Verse 1)
   Python's where the party's at,
   AI videos, that's where we're at.
   From data streams to visual treats,
   Python jive, can't be beat.

   (Chorus)
   Swing to the beat of Python's song,
   Creating videos, all day long.
   With flair and style, we strive,
   Python AI, let's take a dive!

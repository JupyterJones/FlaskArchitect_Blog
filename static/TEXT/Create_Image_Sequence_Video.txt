It seems like you're trying to create a video from a sequence of images using the moviepy library and then play the video using VLC. However, there are a few issues with your code.

First, you are copying the non-existing video file `filename` to `"TEMP3.mp4"` before creating the video. You should remove the line `shutil.copy(filename, "TEMP3.mp4")`.

Second, you are using the `write_videofile` function from moviepy to create the video file. This function already handles the writing process, so you don't need to use `shutil.copy` to copy the file.

Finally, when you're trying to play the video using VLC with the line `!vlc TEMP3.mp4`, the exclamation mark (`!`) is not recognized in Python code. If you want to execute a shell command, you can use the `subprocess` module. Here's an updated version of your code that addresses these issues:

```python
import shutil
import os
import glob
from moviepy.editor import ImageSequenceClip
from PIL import Image
import datetime

imagelist = sorted(glob.glob('animate/*.jpg'), key=os.path.getmtime)

# Create a clip from the images
clip = ImageSequenceClip(imagelist, fps=30)

# Write the clip to a video file using ffmpeg
current_time = datetime.datetime.now()
filename = "animate/" + current_time.strftime('%Y%m%d_%H%M%S%f')[:-3] + 'jul15.mp4'
clip.write_videofile(filename, fps=24, codec='libx265', preset='medium')

# Play the video using VLC
import subprocess
subprocess.run(['vlc', filename])
```

This code will create the video file from the image sequence and then open it using VLC for playback. Make sure you have VLC installed on your system for the command to work properly.

Python how do I delete all *.jpg in animate/   
ChatGPT
To delete all `*.jpg` files in the `animate/` directory using Python, you can use the `os.remove()` function in a loop to delete each file. Here's an example:

```python
import os
import glob

filelist = glob.glob('animate/*.jpg')  # Get a list of all *.jpg files in the animate/ directory

for file_path in filelist:
    os.remove(file_path)  # Delete each file

print("All *.jpg files in animate/ directory have been deleted.")
```

In this code, `glob.glob('animate/*.jpg')` retrieves a list of file paths matching the pattern `'animate/*.jpg'`, which represents all `*.jpg` files in the `animate/` directory. Then, in the loop, `os.remove(file_path)` is used to delete each file one by one. Finally, a message is printed to confirm that all `*.jpg` files in the `animate/` directory have been deleted.

the videos created by my blening are not readable by a browser however they play with vlc  How can I process them with ffmpeg to make the readable by a browser
ChatGPT
To make the videos created by your blending process readable by a browser, you can use ffmpeg to convert them to a browser-compatible format. Here's an example command that you can use with ffmpeg:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset medium -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart output.mp4
```

In this command, you need to replace `input.mp4` with the path to your input video file (the one created by your blending process), and `output.mp4` with the desired path for the converted video file.

Explanation of the options used:

- `-c:v libx264` and `-c:a aac`: These specify the video and audio codecs to use for the output file, respectively. Here, we're using H.264 for video and AAC for audio, which are widely supported by browsers.
- `-crf 23`: This sets the Constant Rate Factor (CRF) for video encoding. Lower values result in higher quality but larger file sizes. A value around 23 is a good balance.
- `-preset medium`: This sets the encoding speed and quality trade-off. The "medium" preset provides a good balance between speed and quality.
- `-b:a 128k`: This sets the audio bitrate to 128kbps. You can adjust this value if needed.
- `-movflags +faststart`: This flag moves the MOOV atom to the beginning of the file, which allows for progressive playback in browsers.

You can execute this ffmpeg command using the `subprocess` module in Python. Here's an example code snippet:

```python
import subprocess

input_file = "path/to/input.mp4"  # Replace with the actual path to your input video file
output_file = "path/to/output.mp4"  # Replace with the desired path for the converted video file

ffmpeg_cmd = f'ffmpeg -i {input_file} -c:v libx264 -crf 23 -preset medium -c:a aac -b:a 128k -movflags +faststart {output_file}'

subprocess.run(ffmpeg_cmd, shell=True)

print("Video conversion complete.")
```

Make sure you have ffmpeg installed on your system and accessible in the command line. The code above executes the ffmpeg command in the shell using `subprocess.run()`. After the conversion is complete, it will print a message indicating that the video conversion is finished.

python command pleae
ChatGPT
Certainly! Here's the Python code snippet using the `subprocess` module to execute the ffmpeg command for converting the video:

```python
import subprocess

input_file = "path/to/input.mp4"  # Replace with the actual path to your input video file
output_file = "path/to/output.mp4"  # Replace with the desired path for the converted video file

ffmpeg_cmd = ['ffmpeg', '-i', input_file, '-c:v', 'libx264', '-crf', '23', '-preset', 'medium', '-c:a', 'aac', '-b:a', '128k', '-movflags', '+faststart', output_file]

subprocess.run(ffmpeg_cmd)

print("Video conversion complete.")
```

In this code, we construct a list `ffmpeg_cmd` that contains the individual components of the ffmpeg command. The `subprocess.run()` function is then used to execute the command. After the conversion is complete, it will print a message indicating that the video conversion is finished.

Remember to replace `"path/to/input.mp4"` with the actual path to your input video file and `"path/to/output.mp4"` with the desired path for the converted video file.

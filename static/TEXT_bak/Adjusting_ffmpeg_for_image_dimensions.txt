ChatGPT


The reason the command may not be working on 512x768 images could be due to the dimensions of the images not being a multiple of 2. The zoompan filter used in the command requires the input dimensions to be a multiple of 2.

To adjust the command for 512x768 images, you can add the scale filter to resize the images to the nearest multiple of 2 before using the zoompan filter. Here's an example of how to modify the command:

```
ffmpeg -y -i 0021.jpg -i 0022.jpg -i 0023.jpg -filter_complex "[0:v]scale='trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2',zoompan=z='zoom+0.0000':d=50[img1];[1:v]scale='trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2',zoompan=z='if(lte(zoom,1.0),1.1,max(1.001,zoom-0.0030))':d=200[img2];[img1][img2]blend=all_expr='if(lte((H/2-sqrt((Y-H/2)*(Y-H/2)))+N*8*SH,H/2),A,B)'[img1img2];[1:v]scale='trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2',zoompan=z='zoom+0.0000':d=50[img2];[2:v]scale='trunc(iw/2)*2:trunc(ih/2)*2',zoompan=z='if(lte(zoom,1.0),1.1,max(1.001,zoom-0.0030))':d=200[img3];[img2][img3]blend=all_expr='if(lte((H/2-sqrt((Y-H/2)*(Y-H/2)))+N*8*SH,H/2),A,B)'[img2img3];[img1img2][img2img3]concat=n=2[final]" -map "[final]" 21-23out.mp4
```

In this modified command, the scale filter is added before the zoompan filter for each input image. The scale filter first rounds the input dimensions to the nearest multiple of 2 and then resizes the image to those dimensions. This ensures that the dimensions of the images are a multiple of 2, which is required by the zoompan filter.

After adding the scale filter, the zoompan filter is applied to each image, followed by the blend filter and the concatenation filter.

Note that this command assumes that the aspect ratio of the input images is 4:3. If your images have a different aspect ratio, you may need to adjust the parameters of the zoompan filter accordingly.

I sometime open multiple terminals is there a way to log all of them to history ?
ChatGPT
Yes, you can log the commands from multiple terminal sessions to a single history file using the following steps:

1. Open the terminal and edit the `.bashrc` file by running the command:

   ```
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. Add the following lines at the end of the file:

   ```
   # Append commands from all terminal sessions to the history file
   shopt -s histappend
   PROMPT_COMMAND='history -a'
   ```

   The `shopt -s histappend` command enables the history file to append new commands from all terminal sessions. The `PROMPT_COMMAND='history -a'` command appends each command to the history file as soon as you enter it.

3. Save and close the file by pressing `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, and then `Enter`.

4. Open a new terminal session and run some commands.

5. Open another terminal session and run some more commands.

6. Close both terminal sessions.

7. Open a new terminal session and run the `history` command to view the history of all commands entered from all terminal sessions.

   ```
   history
   ```

   You should see a list of all the commands you entered from all the terminal sessions.

By following these steps, you can log all commands from multiple terminal sessions to a single history file.

linux ffmpeg capture screen and mic audio 
ChatGPT
You can use the `ffmpeg` command to capture your screen and microphone audio on Linux. Here's an example command:

```
ffmpeg -f x11grab -r 25 -s 1280x720 -i :0.0 -f alsa -ac 2 -i hw:0 output.mp4
```

This command captures the screen at a resolution of 1280x720 and a frame rate of 25 frames per second. It also captures audio from the first ALSA sound card (`hw:0`) with 2 channels.

Here's a breakdown of the command:

- `-f x11grab`: Specifies the input format as X11 screen capture.
- `-r 25`: Specifies the frame rate of the captured video.
- `-s 1280x720`: Specifies the size of the captured video in pixels.
- `-i :0.0`: Specifies the X11 display to capture. `:0.0` is the default display.
- `-f alsa`: Specifies the input format as ALSA audio capture.
- `-ac 2`: Specifies the number of audio channels to capture.
- `-i hw:0`: Specifies the ALSA sound card to capture audio from. `hw:0` is the first sound card.
- `output.mp4`: Specifies the output file name and format.

You can modify the command to suit your needs. For example, you can change the resolution and frame rate of the captured video, or the ALSA sound card and number of audio channels to capture.

Note that capturing screen and audio may consume significant system resources. Also, make sure to have the necessary permissions to capture the screen and audio on your Linux system.

ChatGPT
To reduce the background noise when recording with `ffmpeg`, you can use the noise reduction filter. Here's an example command that uses the noise reduction filter with the `afade` filter to fade in and out the audio:

```
ffmpeg -f alsa -ac 2 -i pulse -f x11grab -r 25 -s 1366x768 -i :0.0 \
-filter_complex " [1:v] scale=1280:-1 [bg]; [0:a] aresample=async=1 [a]; [a] highpass=f=200,lowpass=f=3000,afftdn=nt=w:om=o [a1]; [a1] afade=t=in:st=0:d=0.5,afade=t=out:st=10.0:d=0.5 [a2]; [bg][1:v]overlay=(W-w)/2:(H-h)/2,format=yuv420p[v]" \
-map "[v]" -map "[a2]" -vcodec libx264 -preset ultrafast -crf 0 -threads 0 -acodec pcm_s16le -y output.mkv
```

This command uses the `afftdn` filter to apply noise reduction to the audio. The `highpass` and `lowpass` filters are used to filter out frequencies below 200Hz and above 3000Hz, respectively. The `afade` filter is used to fade in and out the audio to avoid abrupt noise changes.

You can adjust the parameters of the `afftdn` filter to control the noise reduction. For example, you can adjust the `nt` parameter to control the noise reduction strength, and the `om` parameter to control the amount of residual noise.

Note that the noise reduction filter may affect the quality of the audio, so you may need to experiment with different settings to find the best balance between noise reduction and audio quality.

ChatGPT
To filter out background noise when recording audio with `ffmpeg`, you can use the noise reduction filter. Here's an example command that uses the noise reduction filter with the `afade` filter to fade in and out the audio:

```
ffmpeg -f alsa -channels 2 -sample_rate 44100 -i hw:0 \
-filter_complex "[0:a] aresample=async=1 [a]; [a] highpass=f=200,lowpass=f=3000,afftdn=nt=w:om=o [a1]; [a1] afade=t=in:st=0:d=0.5,afade=t=out:st=10.0:d=0.5 [a2]" \
-map "[a2]" -acodec pcm_s16le -y channel2_hw:0out.mp
```

This command uses the `afftdn` filter to apply noise reduction to the audio. The `highpass` and `lowpass` filters are used to filter out frequencies below 200Hz and above 3000Hz, respectively. The `afade` filter is used to fade in and out the audio to avoid abrupt noise changes.

You can adjust the parameters of the `afftdn` filter to control the noise reduction. For example, you can adjust the `nt` parameter to control the noise reduction strength, and the `om` parameter to control the amount of residual noise.

ffmpeg --hide-banner -f alsa -channels 2 -sample_rate 44100 -i hw:0 -filter_complex "[0:a] aresample=async=1 [a]; [a] highpass=f=200,lowpass=f=3000,afftdn=nt=w:om=o [a1]; [a1] afade=t=in:st=0:d=0.5,afade=t=out:st=10.0:d=0.5 [a2]" -map "[a2]" -acodec pcm_s16le -y filterchannel2_hw:0out.mp3

ChatGPT
This command should work to apply noise reduction to the audio recorded from the `hw:0` ALSA device and save the output as an uncompressed PCM WAV file (`pcm_s16le` codec) with the name `filterchannel2_hw:0out.mp3`. However, please note that the extension `.mp3` usually refers to compressed audio files using the MPEG-1/2 Audio Layer III codec, while the output of this command will be an uncompressed WAV file.

You can play the output file using a media player that supports PCM WAV files, such as VLC or Windows Media Player. Alternatively, you can convert the output file to a compressed audio format such as MP3 using `ffmpeg` or another audio converter tool.

Also note that the noise reduction filter parameters in the command may need to be adjusted based on the specific noise characteristics of your recording environment. You can experiment with different filter parameters to achieve the best results for your specific situation.

Unrecognized option '-hide-banner'.
ChatGPT
I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. The correct option to hide the banner in `ffmpeg` is `-loglevel quiet`. Here's the updated command:

```
ffmpeg -loglevel quiet -f alsa -channels 2 -sample_rate 44100 -i hw:0 \
-filter_complex "[0:a] aresample=async=1 [a]; [a] highpass=f=200,lowpass=f=3000,afftdn=nt=w:om=o [a1]; [a1] afade=t=in:st=0:d=0.5,afade=t=out:st=10.0:d=0.5 [a2]" \
-map "[a2]" -acodec pcm_s16le -y filterchannel2_hw:0out.wav
```

This command should apply noise reduction to the audio recorded from the `hw:0` ALSA device and save the output as an uncompressed PCM WAV file (`pcm_s16le` codec) with the name `filterchannel2_hw:0out.wav`. The `-loglevel quiet` option is used to hide the `ffmpeg` banner and reduce the amount of output to the console.

Again, please note that the noise reduction filter parameters may need to be adjusted based on the specific noise characteristics of your recording environment. You can experiment with different filter parameters to achieve the best results for your specific situation.

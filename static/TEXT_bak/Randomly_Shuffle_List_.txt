Randomly Shuffle List.

The code you provided appears to be incomplete and contains an error. The correct syntax for shuffling a list using the `random.sample` method is as follows:

```
import random

random.shuffle(imagelist)
```

This will shuffle the `imagelist` in place, meaning that the original list will be modified and its order will be randomized. The `random.shuffle()` function does not return anything, it simply shuffles the list.

If you specifically want to shuffle a sample of the list, you can use the `random.sample()` method like this:

```
import random

sample_size = 20
shuffled_sample = random.sample(imagelist, sample_size)
```

This will return a new list containing a random sample of 20 elements from the `imagelist`, with their order randomized. Note that if `sample_size` is larger than the length of `imagelist`, this code will raise a `ValueError`.

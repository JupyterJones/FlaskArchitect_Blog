In your FFmpeg command, there seems to be a small mistake in the syntax. You missed a space before the closing quotation mark for the `drawtext` filter's `y` parameter. Here's the corrected command:

```bash
directory_name="TEST"
ffmpeg -hide_banner -f lavfi -i "color=c=darkred:s=1920x1080:d=4" -loop 1 -i "drawtext=text='${directory_name}':fontfile=/home/jack/fonts/freesansbold.ttf:fontsize=45:fontcolor=white:x=(w-text_w)/2:y=(h-text_h)/2" -filter_complex "[0:v][1:v]concat=n=2:v=1:a=0[output]" -map "[output]" -vf "fade=t=in:st=0:d=1:alpha=1, fade=t=out:st=3:d=1:alpha=1" -c:v libx264 -t 4 -y EXPERIMENT/result_image_with_text.mp4
```

Please make sure you have the necessary fonts and paths correctly set up in your environment. If the issue persists, please provide any error messages or additional information about the problem you are encountering.

The error message you received indicates that FFmpeg could not find the specified font file at the given path (`/home/jack/fonts/freesansbold.ttf`). Please verify that the font file exists at the specified location and ensure that the path is correct.

If the font file is located elsewhere or has a different name, you'll need to update the `fontfile` parameter accordingly in your command. Alternatively, you can try using a different font file that is available on your system.

Once you have verified the font file's location and made any necessary changes, please try running the command again.

I checked the fonfile is there and was used on a previous command

If you have confirmed that the font file exists at the specified location and was used successfully in a previous command, there might be another issue causing the error.

One possible reason for the error message is that the font file path contains special characters or spaces that need to be properly escaped. In your command, the font file path (`/home/jack/fonts/freesansbold.ttf`) appears to be fine, but it's worth double-checking for any special characters or spaces.

Another possibility is that the user running the command may not have sufficient permissions to access the font file. Make sure that the user has the necessary read permissions for the font file.

If the issue persists, you can try specifying the font file using an absolute path instead of a relative path. For example, instead of `/home/jack/fonts/freesansbold.ttf`, you can try using `/absolute/path/to/freesansbold.ttf`.

If none of the above solutions work, please provide more information about your operating system, FFmpeg version, and any relevant error messages you receive. That will help in further troubleshooting the issue.

ls /home/jack/fonts/freesansbold.ttf

Since the font file exists at the specified location (`/home/jack/fonts/freesansbold.ttf`), it appears that the path is correct. 

In that case, please try the following troubleshooting steps:

1. Ensure that the font file has the correct file permissions. You can use the `ls -l` command to check the permissions of the font file:
   ```
   ls -l /home/jack/fonts/freesansbold.ttf
   ```
   Make sure that the file has read permissions for the user running the FFmpeg command.

2. Verify that the user running the FFmpeg command has access to the font file and its parent directories. If necessary, adjust the file permissions or ownership accordingly.

3. If you are running FFmpeg command from a different directory, make sure to provide the absolute path to the font file in the command. For example:
   ```
   directory_name="TEST"
   ffmpeg -hide_banner -f lavfi -i "color=c=darkred:s=1920x1080:d=4" -loop 1 -i "drawtext=text='${directory_name}':fontfile=/home/jack/fonts/freesansbold.ttf:fontsize=45:fontcolor=white:x=(w-text_w)/2:y=(h-text_h)/2" -filter_complex "[0:v][1:v]concat=n=2:v=1:a=0[output]" -map "[output]" -vf "fade=t=in:st=0:d=1:alpha=1, fade=t=out:st=3:d=1:alpha=1" -c:v libx264 -t 4 -y /path/to/EXPERIMENT/result_image_with_text.mp4
   ```

If the issue persists after following these steps, please provide the complete error message you receive, as well as the versions of FFmpeg and any relevant information about your operating system. This will help in further diagnosing the problem.

easiest way to run / view / control  another computer on my  home  wireless  network. it is home security is no issue. They both  are Linux.
ChatGPT
The easiest way to control another computer on your home wireless network, especially if security is not a concern, is to use a protocol like SSH (Secure Shell). SSH allows you to securely connect to another computer over a network, and it's commonly used for remote administration.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to set up SSH on both computers:

1. **Install SSH server on the computer you want to control**:
   - On Ubuntu or Debian-based systems, you can install the SSH server with the following command:
     ```
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install openssh-server
     ```
   - On other Linux distributions, the process may vary slightly, but you can typically install the `openssh-server` package using your package manager.

2. **Enable SSH server**:
   - Once installed, the SSH server should start automatically. If not, you may need to start and enable the service. On Ubuntu, you can do this with:
     ```
     sudo systemctl start ssh
     sudo systemctl enable ssh
     ```

3. **Find the IP address of the computer you want to control**:
   - You can find the IP address of the target computer by running `ifconfig` or `ip addr` in a terminal.

4. **From your control computer, open a terminal**:
   - Use the terminal to connect to the target computer via SSH.

5. **Connect to the target computer**:
   - In the terminal on your control computer, use the `ssh` command followed by the username and IP address of the target computer. For example:
     ```
     ssh username@192.168.1.100
     ```
   - Replace `username` with your username on the target computer, and `192.168.1.100` with the IP address of the target computer.

6. **Enter the password**:
   - You'll be prompted to enter the password for the user account on the target computer. Once entered, you'll be logged in to the target computer via SSH.

7. **Control the target computer**:
   - Once connected, you can run commands, view files, and perform any other tasks on the target computer, just as if you were using it directly.

That's it! You're now able to control the target computer from your control computer using SSH. Remember to ensure that both computers are connected to the same home wireless network for this to work. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to ask!

i have that already . how about the visual to view as if  I was there.
ChatGPT
Ah, I see! If you're looking for a way to have a visual representation of the remote computer's desktop as if you were physically present, you can use a tool like VNC (Virtual Network Computing). VNC allows you to remotely view and control the desktop environment of another computer.

Here's how you can set up VNC on both computers:

1. **Install VNC server on the computer you want to control**:
   - You can install a VNC server such as `tightvncserver` on the target computer. On Ubuntu or Debian-based systems, you can do this with:
     ```
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install tightvncserver
     ```

2. **Run the VNC server**:
   - After installation, run the VNC server on the target computer. You can do this by running:
     ```
     tightvncserver
     ```
   - You'll be prompted to set a password for VNC access. Choose a strong password when prompted.

3. **Find the IP address of the target computer**:
   - Similar to before, find the IP address of the target computer using `ifconfig` or `ip addr`.

4. **Install a VNC viewer on your control computer**:
   - There are many VNC viewer applications available for Linux. One popular option is `remmina`. You can install it with:
     ```
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install remmina
     ```

5. **Open Remmina**:
   - Launch the Remmina application on your control computer.

6. **Create a new connection**:
   - In Remmina, click on "Create a new connection profile" and select "VNC" as the protocol.

7. **Enter connection details**:
   - In the connection details, enter the IP address of the target computer and the port number (usually 5900).
   - Enter the username and password you set up for VNC on the target computer.

8. **Connect**:
   - Click "Connect" to establish the VNC connection to the target computer.

9. **View and control the desktop**:
   - Once connected, you should see the desktop environment of the target computer in the Remmina window. You can now interact with it as if you were sitting in front of it.

That's it! You've now set up VNC to remotely view and control the desktop of another computer on your home wireless network. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to ask!

how to verify  it is running
ChatGPT
To verify that the VNC server is running on the target computer, you can check the process status or listen for incoming connections on the VNC server's default port. Here's how:

1. **Check the process status**:
   - Open a terminal on the target computer.
   - Run the following command to check if the VNC server process is running:
     ```
     ps aux | grep vnc
     ```
   - If the VNC server is running, you should see a process related to `tightvncserver` or whichever VNC server you installed.

2. **Check for open ports**:
   - You can also check if the VNC server is listening for incoming connections on the default VNC port (5900) using the `netstat` command:
     ```
     sudo netstat -tuln | grep 5900
     ```
   - If the VNC server is running and configured correctly, you should see a line indicating that the server is listening on port 5900.

3. **Verify remote access**:
   - If you're able to connect to the target computer using a VNC viewer application from another computer on the network, it's a good indicator that the VNC server is running and accessible.

By following these steps, you can verify that the VNC server is running on the target computer. If you encounter any issues or have further questions, feel free to ask!

ChatGPT
It seems that based on the output, the VNC server process is not currently running on the target computer, and there are no processes listening on port 5900, which is the default port for VNC.

To troubleshoot and start the VNC server:

1. **Start the VNC server**:
   - Open a terminal on the target computer.
   - Run the command to start the VNC server. For example, if you're using TightVNC, you can start it with:
     ```
     tightvncserver
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to set up a password for VNC access.

2. **Check the process status**:
   - After starting the VNC server, rerun the `ps aux | grep vnc` command to see if the VNC server process is now running.

3. **Check for open ports**:
   - Similarly, rerun the `sudo netstat -tuln | grep 5900` command to verify if the server is listening on port 5900.

If everything is set up correctly, you should see the VNC server process running and listening on port 5900 after starting it. Once the VNC server is running, you should be able to connect to it using a VNC viewer application from another computer on the network.

New 'X' desktop is jack-Desktop:1

Starting applications specified in /home/jack/.vnc/xstartup
Log file is /home/jack/.vnc/jack-Desktop:1.log

(base) jack@jack-Desktop:~$ sudo netstat -tuln | grep 5900
ChatGPT
It appears that the TightVNC server has been successfully started, as indicated by the message "New 'X' desktop is jack-Desktop:1." This means that a new virtual desktop session has been created and is now available for remote access.

Additionally, the log file for this session is located at `/home/jack/.vnc/jack-Desktop:1.log`, which you can inspect for any further details or error messages.

However, it seems that the `netstat` command did not return any results for port 5900. This might indicate that the VNC server is not currently listening on port 5900.

To ensure that the VNC server is running and listening on port 5900, you can use the following command:

```bash
sudo netstat -tuln | grep 59
```

This command will search for any services listening on ports 5900-5999. If the VNC server is running and configured correctly, you should see an entry indicating that it's listening on port 5900.

If you still encounter issues or have any questions, please let me know!

udp6       0      0 :::36595                :::*  
ChatGPT
It appears that the VNC server is listening on port 5901 instead of the default port 5900. This is indicated by the entry `0.0.0.0:5901`.

To connect to this VNC server from a VNC viewer application on another computer, you'll need to specify the IP address of the target computer along with the port number 5901.

For example, if the IP address of the target computer is `192.168.1.100`, you would connect to it using:

```
192.168.1.100:5901
```

Alternatively, you can configure the VNC server to listen on the default port 5900 by specifying it explicitly when starting the server:

```bash
tightvncserver :0
```

This command would start the VNC server on port 5900. Then you can use `sudo netstat -tuln | grep 5900` to verify that it's listening on the correct port.

will both computers need vncserver ?
ChatGPT
Yes, both computers will need a VNC server installed if you want to establish a VNC connection between them. 

One computer will act as the VNC server, allowing its desktop environment to be accessed remotely, while the other computer will act as the client, from which you will remotely access the server's desktop.

So, if you want to remotely access Computer A from Computer B, you need to install a VNC server on Computer A and a VNC viewer (client) on Computer B.

Here's the breakdown:

- **Computer A (Server)**: Install a VNC server (e.g., TightVNC) to share its desktop.
- **Computer B (Client)**: Install a VNC viewer (e.g., Remmina) to connect to Computer A's desktop.

Once both the server and client components are installed, you can establish a VNC connection from Computer B to Computer A, enabling you to remotely view and control Computer A's desktop environment.

If you have any further questions or need assistance with the setup, feel free to ask!
user
so both do not need vncserver?  the remote just needs a viewer, correct.
ChatGPT
Yes, that's correct! I apologize for any confusion. Only the computer whose desktop you want to access remotely (often referred to as the "server") needs to have a VNC server installed. The computer from which you will be accessing the remote desktop (often referred to as the "client") only needs a VNC viewer installed.

So, to clarify:

- **Computer A (Server)**: Install a VNC server (e.g., TightVNC) to share its desktop.
- **Computer B (Client)**: Install a VNC viewer (e.g., Remmina) to connect to Computer A's desktop.

With this setup, you can use the VNC viewer on Computer B to establish a connection to Computer A's desktop and remotely view and control it.

if the remote requires a  password is it the same as the server username and password? 
ChatGPT
In a typical VNC setup, the password required by the VNC server on the remote computer (the one being accessed) is usually separate from the login credentials (username and password) of the user account on that computer.

When you set up a VNC server, you'll typically be prompted to set a password specifically for VNC access. This password is used by the VNC server to authenticate incoming connections from VNC clients (such as a VNC viewer on another computer). It's important to note that this VNC password is separate from the login password for the user account on the remote computer.

So, to clarify:

- **Server (Remote computer)**: You set up a VNC password during the configuration of the VNC server. This password is used to authenticate remote VNC connections.
  
- **Client (Local computer)**: When you connect to the remote computer from a VNC viewer on your local computer, you'll be prompted to enter this VNC password to authenticate the connection.

The username and password used to log in to the user account on the remote computer are typically not directly related to the VNC authentication process. However, in some VNC server configurations, you may have the option to integrate VNC authentication with system login credentials, but this is less common and depends on the specific VNC server software and configuration.

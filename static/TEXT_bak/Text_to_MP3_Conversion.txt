Text to MP3 Conversion
user

To convert a list of texts to MP3 using Python, you can use the `gtts` (Google Text-to-Speech) library. This library allows you to convert text to speech and save it as an MP3 file. Here's a complete script that takes a list of texts and converts each one into an MP3 file:

1. Install the `gtts` library if you haven't already:

```sh
pip install gtts
```

2. Use the following script to convert the texts to MP3:

```python
from gtts import gTTS
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

def text_to_mp3(text_list, output_folder='output'):
    import os

    # Ensure the output folder exists
    if not os.path.exists(output_folder):
        os.makedirs(output_folder)

    for idx, text in enumerate(text_list):
        try:
            # Create a gTTS object
            tts = gTTS(text=text, lang='en')

            # Define the output file path
            output_file = os.path.join(output_folder, f"text_{idx + 1}.mp3")

            # Save the speech to an MP3 file
            tts.save(output_file)
            logging.info(f'Successfully converted text {idx + 1} to {output_file}')
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f'Error converting text {idx + 1}: {e}')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Sample list of texts
    texts = [
        "Hello, this is the first text.",
        "This is the second text.",
        "Here is the third text."
    ]

    # Convert the list of texts to MP3
    text_to_mp3(texts)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Import Required Libraries**:
   - `gTTS` from the `gtts` module for text-to-speech conversion.
   - `logging` for logging information and errors.

2. **Configure Logging**:
   - Set up logging to print information and error messages to the console.

3. **Function `text_to_mp3`**:
   - Accepts a list of texts and an optional output folder.
   - Ensures the output folder exists.
   - Iterates over the list of texts, converts each text to speech using `gTTS`, and saves it as an MP3 file.

4. **Main Block**:
   - Defines a sample list of texts.
   - Calls the `text_to_mp3` function to convert the texts to MP3 files.

Feel free to modify the list of texts and the output folder path as needed. This script will create an MP3 file for each text in the provided list, saving them in the specified output folder.

i will be using a text the list is double-space delimited video_text.txt

If you have a text file where the list of texts is double-space delimited, you can modify the script to read the file, split the content based on the double spaces, and then convert each segment to an MP3 file. Here's the updated script:

1. Ensure the `gtts` library is installed:

```sh
pip install gtts
```

2. Use the following script to convert the texts from a file to MP3:

```python
from gtts import gTTS
import logging
import os

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

def read_text_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file:
        content = file.read()
    return content.split('  ')  # Split by double spaces

def text_to_mp3(text_list, output_folder='output'):
    # Ensure the output folder exists
    if not os.path.exists(output_folder):
        os.makedirs(output_folder)

    for idx, text in enumerate(text_list):
        try:
            # Create a gTTS object
            tts = gTTS(text=text.strip(), lang='en')

            # Define the output file path
            output_file = os.path.join(output_folder, f"text_{idx + 1}.mp3")

            # Save the speech to an MP3 file
            tts.save(output_file)
            logging.info(f'Successfully converted text {idx + 1} to {output_file}')
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f'Error converting text {idx + 1}: {e}')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Path to the text file
    file_path = 'video_text.txt'

    # Read and split the text file content
    texts = read_text_file(file_path)

    # Convert the list of texts to MP3
    text_to_mp3(texts)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Import Required Libraries**:
   - `gTTS` from the `gtts` module for text-to-speech conversion.
   - `logging` for logging information and errors.
   - `os` for file path operations.

2. **Configure Logging**:
   - Set up logging to print information and error messages to the console.

3. **Function `read_text_file`**:
   - Reads the content of the text file.
   - Splits the content by double spaces to create a list of texts.

4. **Function `text_to_mp3`**:
   - Accepts a list of texts and an optional output folder.
   - Ensures the output folder exists.
   - Iterates over the list of texts, converts each text to speech using `gTTS`, and saves it as an MP3 file.

5. **Main Block**:
   - Defines the path to the text file.
   - Reads and splits the text file content.
   - Calls the `text_to_mp3` function to convert the texts to MP3 files.

This script reads the content from `video_text.txt`, splits it into separate texts based on double spaces, and then converts each text segment to an MP3 file, saving them in the specified output folder. Make sure to place the `video_text.txt` file in the same directory as the script or provide the correct path to the file.

ffmpeg No duplicate frames in an mp4
ChatGPT
To ensure that there are no duplicate frames in an MP4 video using ffmpeg, you can utilize the `mpdecimate` filter. This filter removes duplicate frames while retaining the video's visual quality. Below is a Python script that utilizes ffmpeg to achieve this:

```python
import subprocess
import logging

def remove_duplicate_frames(input_file, output_file):
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

    try:
        # Run ffmpeg command to remove duplicate frames
        cmd = [
            'ffmpeg',
            '-i', input_file,
            '-vf', 'mpdecimate',
            '-c:v', 'libx264',  # You can change the codec if needed
            '-crf', '18',       # Set the desired quality level (lower is better quality)
            '-preset', 'medium',# Set the encoding speed (preset options: ultrafast, superfast, faster, fast, medium, slow, slower, veryslow)
            '-c:a', 'copy',     # Keep the audio codec unchanged
            '-movflags', '+faststart',  # Enable fast start for web playback
            output_file
        ]

        logging.info(f"Running command: {' '.join(cmd)}")

        # Execute the command
        subprocess.run(cmd, check=True)

        logging.info("Duplicate frames removed successfully.")

    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        logging.error(f"Error occurred: {e}")
        raise

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    input_file = "input_video.mp4"
    output_file = "output_video.mp4"

    remove_duplicate_frames(input_file, output_file)
```

This script defines a function `remove_duplicate_frames` that takes an input MP4 file and produces an output MP4 file with no duplicate frames using ffmpeg. It logs information about the process, such as the ffmpeg command being executed and any errors that may occur.

To use this script, replace `"input_video.mp4"` and `"output_video.mp4"` with the paths to your input and desired output files, respectively. Make sure to have ffmpeg installed and accessible in your system's PATH.

Feel free to adjust the encoding parameters (`-crf` and `-preset`) according to your specific requirements for video quality and encoding speed.

bash one liner
ChatGPT
Sure, you can achieve the same result with a bash one-liner using ffmpeg. Here it is:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf mpdecimate -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -preset medium -c:a copy -movflags +faststart output.mp4
```

This command removes duplicate frames from the input video (`input.mp4`) using the `mpdecimate` filter and encodes the result with the `libx264` codec at a constant rate factor (CRF) of 18 and a medium encoding preset. The audio stream is copied directly without re-encoding (`-c:a copy`), and the resulting output video is optimized for web playback with the `+faststart` option. Replace `input.mp4` with the path to your input video file and `output.mp4` with the desired output file name.

very good quality
ChatGPT
If you want to ensure very good quality for the output video while removing duplicate frames, you can adjust the Constant Rate Factor (CRF) value to a lower number. Lower CRF values result in higher quality but larger file sizes. You can also use a slower encoding preset for better compression efficiency.

Here's the updated one-liner with improved quality settings:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf mpdecimate -c:v libx264 -crf 16 -preset slower -c:a copy -movflags +faststart output.mp4
```

In this command, I've lowered the CRF value to 16 for higher quality and changed the preset to "slower," which provides better compression efficiency but takes longer to encode. Adjust the CRF value as needed to balance between quality and file size according to your preferences.

slow video to .1 speed
ChatGPT
To slow down a video to 0.1x speed using ffmpeg, you can use the `setpts` filter to adjust the presentation timestamp of each frame. Here's the bash one-liner to accomplish this:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "setpts=10*PTS" -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -preset medium -c:a copy -movflags +faststart output_slow.mp4
```

In this command:
- `-vf "setpts=10*PTS"`: This filter slows down the video by increasing the presentation timestamp of each frame by a factor of 10. This effectively makes the video play at 0.1x speed.
- `-c:v libx264 -crf 18 -preset medium`: These options specify the video codec (libx264), the constant rate factor (CRF) for video quality (18 for good quality), and the encoding preset (medium for a balance between encoding speed and file size).
- `-c:a copy`: This option copies the audio stream without re-encoding to preserve its quality.
- `-movflags +faststart`: This flag enables fast start for web playback, allowing the video to begin playback before it's fully downloaded.

Replace `input.mp4` with the path to your input video file and `output_slow.mp4` with the desired output file name.

This command will produce a video slowed down to 0.1x speed with good quality. Adjust the CRF value if you need higher or lower video quality.

ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf mpdecimate -c:v libx264 -crf 16 -preset slower -c:a copy -movflags +faststart output.mp4 no sound about two images per second

ChatGPT
To slow down the video to 0.1x speed while removing duplicate frames and retaining sound, you can use the `mpdecimate` filter to remove duplicate frames and then adjust the presentation timestamp of each frame to slow down the video. Here's the modified command:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "mpdecimate,setpts=10*PTS" -af "atempo=0.1" -c:v libx264 -crf 16 -preset slower -c:a copy -movflags +faststart output_slow.mp4
```

Explanation of the command:

- `-vf "mpdecimate,setpts=10*PTS"`: This filter chain first removes duplicate frames with `mpdecimate` and then slows down the video by increasing the presentation timestamp of each frame by a factor of 10.
- `-af "atempo=0.1"`: This audio filter slows down the audio to match the video speed, ensuring synchronization.
- `-c:v libx264 -crf 16 -preset slower`: These options specify the video codec (libx264), the constant rate factor (CRF) for video quality (16 for good quality), and the encoding preset (slower for better compression efficiency).
- `-c:a copy`: This option copies the audio stream without re-encoding to preserve its quality.
- `-movflags +faststart`: This flag enables fast start for web playback.

Replace `input.mp4` with the path to your input video file and `output_slow.mp4` with the desired output file name.

This command will produce a video slowed down to 0.1x speed with good quality and synchronized audio. Adjust the CRF value if you need higher or lower video quality.

ffmpeg -i orig.mkv -vf "mpdecimate,setpts=.25*PTS" -c:v libx264 -crf 16 -preset slower -c:a copy -movflags +faststart -y output_slow.mp4
no audio stop when video is over 
ChatGPT
If the audio stops when the video ends, it might be due to the fact that the audio duration doesn't match the slowed-down video duration. To ensure that the audio continues for the entire duration of the slowed-down video, you can use the `atempo` filter to adjust the audio speed accordingly. Here's the modified command:

```bash
ffmpeg -i orig.mkv -vf "mpdecimate,setpts=.25*PTS" -af "atempo=4.0" -c:v libx264 -crf 16 -preset slower -c:a copy -movflags +faststart -y output_slow.mp4
```

Explanation of the command:

- `-vf "mpdecimate,setpts=.25*PTS"`: This filter chain removes duplicate frames with `mpdecimate` and then slows down the video by setting the presentation timestamp of each frame to 0.25 times its original value, effectively slowing it down to 0.25x speed.
- `-af "atempo=4.0"`: This audio filter speeds up the audio by a factor of 4 to match the slowed-down video speed. Since the video is slowed down to 0.25x speed, the audio needs to be sped up by 4 times to maintain synchronization.
- `-c:v libx264 -crf 16 -preset slower`: These options specify the video codec (libx264), the constant rate factor (CRF) for video quality (16 for good quality), and the encoding preset (slower for better compression efficiency).
- `-c:a copy`: This option copies the audio stream without re-encoding to preserve its quality.
- `-movflags +faststart`: This flag enables fast start for web playback.
- `-y`: This option automatically overwrites the output file if it already exists.

Replace `orig.mkv` with the path to your input video file and `output_slow.mp4` with the desired output file name.

This command will produce a slowed-down video with synchronized audio that continues for the entire duration of the video. Adjust the CRF value if you need higher or lower video quality.

i want NO NO NO AUDIO
ChatGPT
If you want to remove the audio completely from the output video, you can simply omit the audio codec (`-c:a copy`) from the command. Here's the updated command without audio:

```bash
ffmpeg -i orig.mkv -vf "mpdecimate,setpts=.25*PTS" -c:v libx264 -crf 16 -preset slower -an -movflags +faststart -y output_slow.mp4
```

Explanation of the command:

- `-vf "mpdecimate,setpts=.25*PTS"`: This filter chain removes duplicate frames with `mpdecimate` and then slows down the video by setting the presentation timestamp of each frame to 0.25 times its original value, effectively slowing it down to 0.25x speed.
- `-c:v libx264 -crf 16 -preset slower`: These options specify the video codec (libx264), the constant rate factor (CRF) for video quality (16 for good quality), and the encoding preset (slower for better compression efficiency).
- `-an`: This option disables audio encoding, ensuring that no audio is included in the output video.
- `-movflags +faststart`: This flag enables fast start for web playback.
- `-y`: This option automatically overwrites the output file if it already exists.

Replace `orig.mkv` with the path to your input video file and `output_slow.mp4` with the desired output file name.

This command will produce a slowed-down video with no audio included in the output. Adjust the CRF value if you need higher or lower video quality.

ffmpeg -i $1 -vf "fps=60,scale=8000:-1,zoompan=z='pzoom+0.001':x=iw/2-(iw/zoom/2):y=ih/2-(ih/zoom/2):d=1:s=512x768:fps=60" -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p -y output$1 what would make this zoom a little less
ChatGPT
To adjust the zoom effect to be less pronounced, you can decrease the zoom factor in the `zoompan` filter. Here's the modified command with a reduced zoom factor:

```bash
ffmpeg -i $1 -vf "fps=60,scale=8000:-1,zoompan=z='pzoom+0.0005':x=iw/2-(iw/zoom/2):y=ih/2-(ih/zoom/2):d=1:s=512x768:fps=60" -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p -y output$1
```

Explanation of the command:

- `-vf "fps=60,scale=8000:-1,zoompan=z='pzoom+0.0005':x=iw/2-(iw/zoom/2):y=ih/2-(ih/zoom/2):d=1:s=512x768:fps=60"`: This filter chain applies the following transformations to the video:
  - `fps=60`: Sets the frame rate to 60 frames per second.
  - `scale=8000:-1`: Scales the video to a width of 8000 pixels while preserving the aspect ratio.
  - `zoompan`: Applies a zoom and pan effect to the video.
    - `z='pzoom+0.0005'`: Defines the zoom factor. Adjust this value to control the level of zoom. A smaller value will result in less pronounced zoom.
    - `x=iw/2-(iw/zoom/2)`: Sets the x-coordinate of the zoomed area.
    - `y=ih/2-(ih/zoom/2)`: Sets the y-coordinate of the zoomed area.
    - `d=1`: Sets the duration of the zoom effect to 1 frame.
    - `s=512x768`: Sets the output resolution to 512x768 pixels.
- `-c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p`: Specifies the video codec (libx264) and pixel format (yuv420p) for the output video.
- `-y`: Automatically overwrites the output file if it already exists.

Replace `$1` with the input video file name.

This command will apply a zoom effect with a reduced zoom factor, resulting in a less pronounced zoom in the output video. Adjust the zoom factor as needed to achieve the desired level of zoom.

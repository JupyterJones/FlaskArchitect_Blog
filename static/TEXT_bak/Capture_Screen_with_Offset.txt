Certainly, Jack! To capture the screen with an offset of 5 pixels from the left and 50 pixels down, you can modify the `x11grab` input in your ffmpeg command. Here's the updated command:

```bash
ffmpeg -f x11grab -video_size 730x420 -i :0.0+5,50 -f pulse -i default -c:v libx264 -c:a aac -strict experimental -b:a 192k -y -t 14 output.mp4
```

Explanation:
- The `:0.0+5,50` part specifies the screen capture area. The `+5` means it starts 5 pixels from the left, and `,50` means it starts 50 pixels down from the top.

Feel free to run this command and let me know if you encounter any issues. If you have specific requirements or if you want to add more features to this command, just let me know!

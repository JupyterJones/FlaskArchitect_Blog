when i use audacity it graphs from the bottom not the center sounds are distorted
ChatGPT
It sounds like you're experiencing issues with how Audacity displays and processes audio files. Audacity typically displays audio waveforms with the baseline at the center, which represents zero amplitude. However, if the audio appears to be distorted or if the waveform is not centered properly, it could be due to several reasons:

1. **Incorrect Import Settings:** When importing audio files into Audacity, it's essential to ensure that the settings are correct. For example, if the import settings interpret stereo files as dual mono or vice versa, it can result in distorted audio or misaligned waveforms.

2. **Clipping or Overloading:** If the audio waveform exceeds the maximum amplitude range (clipping), it can lead to distortion. Check if the waveform peaks are hitting the top or bottom edges of the Audacity window, indicating clipping.

3. **Incorrect Playback Settings:** Audacity offers various playback and recording settings that can affect how audio is processed and displayed. Ensure that the playback settings, including sample rate, bit depth, and channel configuration, match the specifications of your audio file.

4. **Audio Effects or Plugins:** If you've applied audio effects or plugins within Audacity, they could potentially introduce distortion or alter the waveform's appearance. Try disabling any effects or plugins to see if it resolves the issue.

5. **Zoom Level:** Sometimes, the waveform may appear distorted due to the zoom level being too high or too low. Adjust the zoom level to get a clearer view of the waveform and verify if it's centered correctly.

6. **Audio Interface Settings:** If you're using an external audio interface or sound card, its settings may affect how Audacity processes audio. Check the configuration of your audio interface to ensure it's compatible with Audacity and configured correctly.

7. **Audacity Version:** Ensure that you're using the latest version of Audacity, as newer versions may include bug fixes and improvements that address issues with audio playback and waveform display.

If you've checked these factors and are still experiencing issues, you may need to troubleshoot further or seek assistance from Audacity's support resources or community forums. Additionally, providing more details about the specific symptoms and circumstances of the distortion can help pinpoint the cause more accurately.

3. **Stop Recording:**
   To stop recording, you can press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where `parec` is running.

4. **Playback Recorded Audio:**
   You can use any audio player to playback the recorded audio file (`output.wav`). For example:

   ```bash
   paplay output.wav
   ```

That's it! You've now recorded audio from the command line using PulseAudio's `parec` utility. Adjust the parameters (`--rate`, `--channels`, etc.) as needed to match your system's audio configuration.

It seems you have three available audio input sources listed:

1. **Source 0:**
   - Name: alsa_input.usb-Sonix_Technology_Co.__Ltd._A4tech_FHD_1080P_PC_Camera_SN0001-02.mono-fallback
   - Description: USB camera acting as an audio input source
   - Format: s16le 1ch 44100Hz
   - Status: SUSPENDED

2. **Source 1:**
   - Name: alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo.monitor
   - Description: Monitor of analog stereo output device
   - Format: s16le 2ch 44100Hz
   - Status: IDLE

3. **Source 2:**
   - Name: alsa_input.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo
   - Description: Analog stereo input device
   - Format: s16le 2ch 44100Hz
   - Status: SUSPENDED

Based on this information, you can choose one of the available sources to test recording from the command line.

For example, to test recording from the USB camera acting as an audio input source (Source 0), you can use the `parec` command:

```bash
parec --device="alsa_input.usb-Sonix_Technology_Co.__Ltd._A4tech_FHD_1080P_PC_Camera_SN0001-02.mono-fallback" --format=s16le --rate=44100 --channels=1 output.wav
```

This command will record audio from the specified input device and save it to a file named `output.wav` in the current directory.

Feel free to choose the appropriate source based on your requirements and run the `parec` command accordingly. Let me know if you need further assistance!

My apologies for the oversight. Let's correct that.

To record audio from your speakers (speaker output) as the audio source, you can use the monitor of your analog stereo output device. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Identify the Monitor Source:**
   From the output of `pactl list short sources`, you can see that `alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo.monitor` is listed as the monitor source for your analog stereo output device.

2. **Record Audio from Monitor Source:**
   You can use the `parec` command to record audio from this monitor source:

   ```bash
   parec --device="alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo.monitor" --format=s16le --rate=44100 --channels=2 output.wav
   ```

   This command will record audio from the monitor source of your analog stereo output device and save it to a file named `output.wav` in the current directory.

3. **Stop Recording:**
   To stop recording, you can press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where `parec` is running.

4. **Playback Recorded Audio:**
   You can use any audio player to playback the recorded audio file (`output.wav`). For example:

   ```bash
   paplay output.wav
   ```

This should allow you to record audio from your speakers (speaker output) using PulseAudio's monitor source. Let me know if you need further assistance!

Hey Jack, it happens to the best of us! To stop a `git push` that has been started but you want to cancel, you can use the following steps:

1. First, make sure you're in the same terminal or command prompt where you initiated the `git push`.

2. Press `Ctrl + C` to interrupt the ongoing push operation. This sends an interrupt signal to the process, which should stop the push.

3. After you've stopped the push, you can add your environment file to `.gitignore` to ensure it won't be pushed in the future. Edit your `.gitignore` file to include the path to your environment file, like this:

   ```
   # Add your environment file to .gitignore
   .env
   ```

4. Save the changes to your `.gitignore` file.

5. Now, you can commit the changes to your `.gitignore` file:

   ```bash
   git add .gitignore
   git commit -m "Updated .gitignore to exclude .env"
   ```

6. Finally, you can push your updated `.gitignore` to the remote repository:

   ```bash
   git push
   ```

This way, your environment file will be excluded from future pushes, and you've resolved the issue. Let me know if you need further assistance or have any questions!

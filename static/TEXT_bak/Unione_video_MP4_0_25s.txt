ffmpeg join 2 mp4 blend 1/4 a second
ChatGPT
Sure, Jack, I can help you create a Python script to join two MP4 videos and blend them for a quarter of a second using `ffmpeg`. This will require you to have `ffmpeg` installed on your Linux computer. Here's a complete script with detailed comments and logging:

```python
import subprocess
import logging

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='video_processing.log', level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(message)s')

# Define the paths to your input videos and output video
video1_path = 'input_video1.mp4'
video2_path = 'input_video2.mp4'
output_path = 'output_video.mp4'

# Define the blending duration in seconds (1/4 second)
blend_duration = 0.25

try:
    # Use FFmpeg to blend the videos
    ffmpeg_command = f'ffmpeg -i {video1_path} -i {video2_path} ' \
                     f'-filter_complex "[0:v]format=pix_fmts=yuva420p,fade=t=out:st={blend_duration}:d=1:alpha=1 ' \
                     f'[a];[1:v][a]overlay" -c:v libx264 -t {blend_duration} {output_path}'
    
    # Execute the FFmpeg command
    subprocess.call(ffmpeg_command, shell=True)

    logging.info('Video blending completed successfully.')

except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f'An error occurred: {e}')

# Remember to close the log file
logging.shutdown()
```

In this script:
- We define the paths to your input videos (`video1_path` and `video2_path`) and the desired output video (`output_path`).
- The `blend_duration` variable is set to 0.25 seconds, which is equivalent to a quarter of a second.
- We use FFmpeg to blend the two videos together using the `fade` and `overlay` filters. The `ffmpeg_command` string specifies the FFmpeg command to execute.
- We use the `subprocess` module to run the FFmpeg command within the Python script.

Please make sure to replace `'input_video1.mp4'` and `'input_video2.mp4'` with the actual file paths of your input videos and provide a suitable output file path.

You can run this script, and it will blend the two videos for a quarter of a second and save the result to the specified output file.

Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance, Jack!

what if i join three
ChatGPT
If you want to join three MP4 videos together using `ffmpeg`, you can modify the script like this:

```python
import subprocess
import logging

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='video_processing.log', level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(message)s')

# Define the paths to your input videos and output video
video1_path = 'input_video1.mp4'
video2_path = 'input_video2.mp4'
video3_path = 'input_video3.mp4'
output_path = 'output_video.mp4'

# Define the blending duration in seconds (1/4 second)
blend_duration = 0.25

try:
    # Use FFmpeg to blend the videos
    ffmpeg_command = (
        f'ffmpeg -i {video1_path} -i {video2_path} -i {video3_path} '
        f'-filter_complex "[0:v]format=pix_fmts=yuva420p,fade=t=out:st={blend_duration}:d=1:alpha=1 [a];'
        f'[1:v]format=pix_fmts=yuva420p,fade=t=out:st={blend_duration}:d=1:alpha=1 [b];'
        f'[2:v][a]overlay=shortest=1[ab];[ab][b]overlay" -c:v libx264 -t {blend_duration} {output_path}'
    )
    
    # Execute the FFmpeg command
    subprocess.call(ffmpeg_command, shell=True)

    logging.info('Video blending completed successfully.')

except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f'An error occurred: {e}')

# Remember to close the log file
logging.shutdown()
```

In this modified script:
- We added a `video3_path` variable to specify the path of the third input video.
- The `ffmpeg_command` now includes three input video sources and applies blending to all of them. It uses the `overlay` filter to combine the videos.

Make sure to replace `'input_video1.mp4'`, `'input_video2.mp4'`, and `'input_video3.mp4'` with the actual file paths of your input videos and provide a suitable output file path.

This script will join and blend three videos for a quarter of a second each and save the result to the specified output file. If you have any questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask, Jack!

the videos are only about 4 secons long
ChatGPT
If your videos are only about 4 seconds long and you want to blend them for a quarter of a second, you can adjust the script as follows:

```python
import subprocess
import logging

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='video_processing.log', level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(message)s')

# Define the paths to your input videos and output video
video1_path = 'input_video1.mp4'
video2_path = 'input_video2.mp4'
video3_path = 'input_video3.mp4'
output_path = 'output_video.mp4'

# Define the blending duration in seconds (1/4 second)
blend_duration = 0.25

try:
    # Use FFmpeg to blend the videos
    ffmpeg_command = (
        f'ffmpeg -i {video1_path} -i {video2_path} -i {video3_path} '
        f'-filter_complex "[0:v]format=pix_fmts=yuva420p,fade=t=out:st={blend_duration}:d={blend_duration}:alpha=1 [a];'
        f'[1:v]format=pix_fmts=yuva420p,fade=t=out:st={blend_duration}:d={blend_duration}:alpha=1 [b];'
        f'[2:v]format=pix_fmts=yuva420p,fade=t=out:st={blend_duration}:d={blend_duration}:alpha=1 [c];'
        f'[a][b]overlay,format=yuva420p[vab];[vab][c]overlay=format=yuv420[vabc]" -map "[vabc]" -t {blend_duration} {output_path}'
    )
    
    # Execute the FFmpeg command
    subprocess.call(ffmpeg_command, shell=True)

    logging.info('Video blending completed successfully.')

except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f'An error occurred: {e}')

# Remember to close the log file
logging.shutdown()
```

In this adjusted script:
- We set the `fade` filter duration to the `blend_duration` for all three videos, which is 0.25 seconds. This ensures that the blending takes place over the specified time.

Make sure to replace `'input_video1.mp4'`, `'input_video2.mp4'`, and `'input_video3.mp4'` with the actual file paths of your input videos, and provide a suitable output file path.

This script will blend your three 4-second videos for a quarter of a second and save the result to the specified output file. If you have any further questions or need assistance, please feel free to ask, Jack!

 -t {blend_duration}   that makes the whole video .25 second long ?
ChatGPT
You're correct, the `-t` option in the FFmpeg command will set the duration of the output video to the value of `blend_duration`, effectively making the entire output video just 0.25 seconds long. If you want the resulting video to maintain the original duration (4 seconds) while only blending for a quarter of a second, you should adjust the command as follows:

```python
import subprocess
import logging

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(filename='video_processing.log', level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(message)s')

# Define the paths to your input videos and output video
video1_path = 'input_video1.mp4'
video2_path = 'input_video2.mp4'
video3_path = 'input_video3.mp4'
output_path = 'output_video.mp4'

# Define the blending duration in seconds (1/4 second)
blend_duration = 0.25

try:
    # Use FFmpeg to blend the videos
    ffmpeg_command = (
        f'ffmpeg -i {video1_path} -i {video2_path} -i {video3_path} '
        f'-filter_complex "[0:v]format=pix_fmts=yuva420p,fade=t=out:st=0:d={blend_duration}:alpha=1 [a];'
        f'[1:v]format=pix_fmts=yuva420p,fade=t=out:st=0:d={blend_duration}:alpha=1 [b];'
        f'[2:v]format=pix_fmts=yuva420p,fade=t=out:st=0:d={blend_duration}:alpha=1 [c];'
        f'[a][b]overlay,format=yuva420p[vab];[vab][c]overlay=format=yuv420[vabc]" -map "[vabc]" -t 4 {output_path}'
    )
    
    # Execute the FFmpeg command
    subprocess.call(ffmpeg_command, shell=True)

    logging.info('Video blending completed successfully.')

except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f'An error occurred: {e}')

# Remember to close the log file
logging.shutdown()
```

In this revised script, I've set `-t` to `4`, which ensures that the output video maintains the original duration (4 seconds) while blending the videos for a quarter of a second.

Make sure to replace `'input_video1.mp4'`, `'input_video2.mp4'`, and `'input_video3.mp4'` with the actual file paths of your input videos and provide a suitable output file path.

This script will blend your three 4-second videos for a quarter of a second and keep the original video duration intact. If you have any further questions or need assistance, please feel free to ask!

this is not working right. can you make bash script?
ChatGPT
I apologize for the inconvenience. If you prefer to create a Bash script for this task, you can do so with the following code. This script will blend three videos while maintaining their original duration:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the paths to your input videos
video1="input_video1.mp4"
video2="input_video2.mp4"
video3="input_video3.mp4"
output="output_video.mp4"

# Define the blending duration in seconds (1/4 second)
blend_duration=0.25

# Use FFmpeg to blend the videos
ffmpeg -i "$video1" -i "$video2" -i "$video3" \
  -filter_complex "[0:v]format=pix_fmts=yuva420p,fade=t=out:st=0:d=$blend_duration:alpha=1 [a]; \
                   [1:v]format=pix_fmts=yuva420p,fade=t=out:st=0:d=$blend_duration:alpha=1 [b]; \
                   [2:v]format=pix_fmts=yuva420p,fade=t=out:st=0:d=$blend_duration:alpha=1 [c]; \
                   [a][b]overlay,format=yuva420p[vab];[vab][c]overlay=format=yuv420[vabc]" \
  -map "[vabc]" -t 4 "$output"

echo "Video blending completed successfully."
```

This Bash script does the same video blending operation as the Python script but without setting the output duration to the blending time, so it maintains the original video duration. Make sure to replace the video file paths and output file path with your specific file names.

Save this script to a file, make it executable with `chmod +x script_name.sh`, and then run it to blend your videos. If you encounter any issues or have further questions, please let me know.
user
why not let the video end when finished instead of -t 4 ?
ChatGPT
You are correct; if you want the output video to end when the last input video finishes, you can simply omit the `-t` option and let FFmpeg determine the output video's duration automatically based on the input videos' duration. Here's the updated Bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the paths to your input videos
video1="input_video1.mp4"
video2="input_video2.mp4"
video3="input_video3.mp4"
output="output_video.mp4"

# Define the blending duration in seconds (1/4 second)
blend_duration=0.25

# Use FFmpeg to blend the videos
ffmpeg -i "$video1" -i "$video2" -i "$video3" \
  -filter_complex "[0:v]format=pix_fmts=yuva420p,fade=t=out:st=0:d=$blend_duration:alpha=1 [a]; \
                   [1:v]format=pix_fmts=yuva420p,fade=t=out:st=0:d=$blend_duration:alpha=1 [b]; \
                   [2:v]format=pix_fmts=yuva420p,fade=t=out:st=0:d=$blend_duration:alpha=1 [c]; \
                   [a][b]overlay,format=yuva420p[vab];[vab][c]overlay=format=yuv420[vabc]" \
  -map "[vabc]" "$output"

echo "Video blending completed successfully."
```

Now, the script will blend your videos while maintaining the original duration, and the output video will end when the last input video finishes.

Make sure to replace the video file paths and output file path with your specific file names. Save and execute the script as described in the previous message. If you have any more questions or need further assistance, please feel free to ask.

#!/bin/bash

# Define the paths to your input videos

video2='fish-good-generation.mp4'
output='fish-good-generation_ab2.mp4'

# Define the blending duration in seconds (1/4 second)
blend_duration=0.25

# Use FFmpeg to blend the videos
ffmpeg -i "$video1" -i "$video2" \
  -filter_complex "[0:v]format=pix_fmts=yuva420p,fade=t=out:st=0:d=$blend_duration:alpha=1 [a]; \
                   [1:v]format=pix_fmts=yuva420p,fade=t=out:st=0:d=$blend_duration:alpha=1 [b]; \
                   [a][b]overlay,format=yuva420p[vab]" -map "[vab]" "$output"

echo "Video blending completed successfully."
it only shows one full video the a.25 secon clip of the second one
ChatGPT
I see the issue in your script. It appears that you want to blend two videos, but the script you provided is blending them over a duration of 0.25 seconds, causing the second video to be displayed for only that duration. To blend the videos while keeping the original duration, you should remove the `fade` filter duration for the second video.

Here's the corrected script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the paths to your input videos
video1='fish-good-generationa.mp4'
video2='fish-good-generation.mp4'
output='fish-good-generation_ab2.mp4'

# Use FFmpeg to blend the videos
ffmpeg -i "$video1" -i "$video2" \
  -filter_complex "[0:v]format=pix_fmts=yuva420p,fade=t=out:st=0:d=0.25:alpha=1 [a]; \
                   [1:v]format=pix_fmts=yuva420p [b]; \
                   [a][b]overlay,format=yuva420p[vab]" -map "[vab]" "$output"

echo "Video blending completed successfully."
```

In this corrected script, we've removed the `fade` filter duration for the second video (`[1:v]`), allowing it to maintain its original duration. Now, the output video will have the same duration as the longer of the two input videos.

Please give this script a try, and it should produce the desired output with both videos intact. If you have any further questions or need more assistance, feel free to ask.

still broken,,, both videos are not showing
ChatGPT
I apologize for the inconvenience. It appears there may be an issue with the video codecs or file format. To ensure that both videos are shown, you can use the `concat` filter in FFmpeg. Here's a modified script that should work:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define the paths to your input videos
video1='fish-good-generationa.mp4'
video2='fish-good-generation.mp4'
output='fish-good-generation_ab2.mp4'

# Create a text file to list the input videos
echo "file '$video1'" > input.txt
echo "file '$video2'" >> input.txt

# Use FFmpeg to concatenate the videos
ffmpeg -f concat -safe 0 -i input.txt -c:v libx264 -crf 18 -preset veryfast -c:a aac -strict experimental "$output"

echo "Video blending completed successfully."
```

In this script:

1. We create a text file `input.txt` that lists the input video files.

2. We use FFmpeg to concatenate the videos using the `concat` filter. This method should ensure that both videos are shown in their entirety in the output.

Please try this script, and it should produce the desired result with both videos intact. If you encounter any further issues or have additional questions, please let me know.

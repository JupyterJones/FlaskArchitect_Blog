how to start a python server to serve files
ChatGPT
Certainly, Jack! Starting a Python server to serve files is quite straightforward. You can use the built-in `http.server` module. Here's a simple script that creates a basic file server:

```python
import http.server
import socketserver
import logging

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
logger = logging.getLogger("FileServer")

# Define the port you want to use
port = 8000

# Define the handler to use (SimpleHTTPRequestHandler serves files from the current directory)
handler = http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler

# Start the server
with socketserver.TCPServer(("", port), handler) as httpd:
    logger.info(f"Serving on port {port}")
    try:
        # This will serve files indefinitely until you stop the script manually (Ctrl+C)
        httpd.serve_forever()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        logger.info("Server stopped.")
```

Save this script with a `.py` extension, for example, `file_server.py`, and run it using the command:

```bash
python file_server.py
```

This will start a server on port 8000, and you can access your files by navigating to `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

Feel free to ask if you have any questions or need further clarification, Jack!

a one liner for the terminal
ChatGPT
Certainly, Jack! You can use Python's built-in HTTP server directly from the terminal with this one-liner:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Replace `8000` with the port you prefer. Just navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser, and you'll have your files served.

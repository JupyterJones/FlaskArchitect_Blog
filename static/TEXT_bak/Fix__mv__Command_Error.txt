It seems like you're encountering an issue with the `mv` command while trying to move multiple JPEG files to a new folder. The error message indicates that the filename `--c1BT2TTiCpuBJjxTBdQw.jpg` is being interpreted as an option rather than a filename.

This issue occurs because the filename starts with a hyphen (`-`), which is interpreted by the `mv` command as an option. To resolve this, you can use the `--` option to indicate the end of options, telling `mv` that what follows are filenames, not options.

Here's how you can do it:

```bash
mv -- *.jpg ../NewFolder
```

By using `--` before `*.jpg`, you're indicating to the `mv` command that any subsequent arguments are filenames, regardless of whether they start with a hyphen.

This should resolve the issue, and the `mv` command should move all JPEG files to the specified folder without any errors. Let me know if you need further assistance!

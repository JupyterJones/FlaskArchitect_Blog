AttributeError: shape

ChatGPT
The error you encountered is due to a problem with the `Image` object from the PIL library. The `Image` object does not have a `shape` attribute, which is causing the `AttributeError`. 

To resolve this issue, you can convert the `Image` object to a NumPy array and then retrieve its shape. Here's an updated version of your code that includes this change:

```python
from moviepy.editor import VideoClip
from moviepy.audio.io.AudioFileClip import AudioFileClip
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np

image_path = '/home/jack/Desktop/HDD500/collections/Avatar_resources/1080_2022-12-05-07_141670195699.png'
image_ = Image.open(image_path)
image_np = np.array(image_)  # Convert Image to NumPy array
audio_path = '/home/jack/Desktop/HDD500/MyTube_AI_Flask_App/sample_data/input_audio.wav'

image = VideoClip(lambda t: image_np, duration=AudioFileClip(audio_path).duration)
audio = AudioFileClip(audio_path)

output_file = '/home/jack/Desktop/HDD500/MyTube_AI_Flask_App/sample_data/input_video.mp4'
video = image.set_audio(audio)

video.write_videofile(output_file, codec='libx264', audio_codec='aac')
```

By converting the `Image` object to a NumPy array, you can access the shape of the image and create a valid `VideoClip` object.

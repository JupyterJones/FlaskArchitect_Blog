ChatGPT
To create a video from a still image using MoviePy and make it the same length as an audio file, you can follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies. If you haven't already, install MoviePy by running the command `pip install moviepy` in your Python environment.

2. Import the required modules:

```python
from moviepy.editor import VideoClip
from moviepy.audio.io.AudioFileClip import AudioFileClip
```

3. Set the paths to your input files. Replace `'still.jpg'` with the path to your image file and `'voice.wav'` with the path to your audio file.

```python
image_path = 'still.jpg'
audio_path = 'voice.wav'
```

4. Load the image and audio files using MoviePy:

```python
image = VideoClip(lambda t: image_path, duration=AudioFileClip(audio_path).duration)
audio = AudioFileClip(audio_path)
```

5. Set the output video file name and create a composite video clip with the image and audio:

```python
output_file = 'video.mp4'
video = image.set_audio(audio)
```

6. Write the video clip to the output file:

```python
video.write_videofile(output_file, codec='libx264', audio_codec='aac')
```

The complete code should look like this:

```python
from moviepy.editor import VideoClip
from moviepy.audio.io.AudioFileClip import AudioFileClip

image_path = 'still.jpg'
audio_path = 'voice.wav'

image = VideoClip(lambda t: image_path, duration=AudioFileClip(audio_path).duration)
audio = AudioFileClip(audio_path)

output_file = 'video.mp4'
video = image.set_audio(audio)

video.write_videofile(output_file, codec='libx264', audio_codec='aac')
```

Make sure to replace `'still.jpg'`, `'voice.wav'`, and `'video.mp4'` with the actual paths and filenames you want to use.

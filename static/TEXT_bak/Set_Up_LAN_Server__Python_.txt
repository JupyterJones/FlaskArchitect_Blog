Jack, to set up a simple server for serving files on your local network without relying on an `index.html` file, you can use Python's built-in HTTP server module. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open a terminal on your Linux computer.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the files you want to serve.

3. Run the following command to start a basic HTTP server:

```bash
python -m http.server
```

This will start a server on port 8000 by default. If you want to use a different port, replace `8000` with your desired port number.

4. Once the server is running, you can access the files on your LAN by entering your computer's IP address in a web browser on any device connected to your local network, followed by the chosen port number. For example:

```
http://your_computer_ip:8000
```

Replace `your_computer_ip` with the actual IP address of your Linux machine.

This Python server will serve files from the current directory, and if there is no `index.html` file, it will display a directory listing by default.

Using PHP or other server technologies is possible but might be overcomplicated for a basic file-serving task on your LAN. The Python built-in server is a simple and effective choice for this purpose.

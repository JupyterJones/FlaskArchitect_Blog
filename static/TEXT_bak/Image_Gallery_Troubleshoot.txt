To troubleshoot the issue, let's check a few things and make some adjustments.

1. **Ensure that Flask is Importing render_template and glob**: Make sure you have imported `render_template` and `glob` from the Flask and Python libraries, respectively.

2. **Check File Paths**: Confirm that the path to the images is correct. The current code assumes that the images are stored in the `static/uploads/` directory relative to the script file.

3. **Passing the Correct Variable**: In the template (`gallery.html`), you're iterating over `image_files`, but in the Flask route (`gallery()`), you're passing `image_list`. Make sure you pass the correct variable name.

4. **Verify Image Extensions**: Ensure that all the files in the `static/uploads/` directory are indeed JPEG files. The code currently only looks for files with a `.jpg` extension.

Let's make the necessary adjustments to the code:

```python
import glob
from flask import render_template

@app.route('/gallery')
def gallery():
    # Get a list of image filenames in /static/uploads/
    image_files = [filename.split('/')[-1] for filename in glob.glob("static/uploads/*.jpg")]  
    return render_template('gallery.html', image_files=image_files)
```

```html
<!-- templates/gallery.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Image Gallery</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Image Gallery</h1>
    {% for image in image_files %}
        <h2>{{ image }}</h2>
        <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='uploads/' + image) }}" alt="{{ image }}">
        <button onclick="selectImage('{{ image }}')">Select</button>
    {% endfor %}
</body>
</html>
```

Make sure the paths are correct, and the files have the `.jpg` extension. This should resolve the issue. If it persists, check the Flask server logs for any errors or exceptions. Let me know if you need further assistance!

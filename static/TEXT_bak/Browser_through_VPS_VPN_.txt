Browser through VPS VPN.
user
can I route just my browser through a VPS settup as a vpn ?
ChatGPT
Yes, you can route just your browser traffic through a VPS setup as a VPN. One common way to achieve this is by using a proxy server within your browser settings.

Here's a step-by-step guide to setting this up:

1. **Obtain a VPS**: You'll need a Virtual Private Server (VPS) with VPN capabilities. Many VPS providers offer VPN services or you can set up your own VPN server on a VPS using software like OpenVPN or WireGuard.

2. **Set up VPN on VPS**: Install and configure the VPN software on your VPS according to your provider's instructions.

3. **Configure Browser Proxy Settings**:
   - Open your browser's settings.
   - Look for the section related to proxies or network settings.
   - Enter the IP address of your VPS and the port number of your VPN service as the proxy server. The port number will depend on the VPN protocol you're using (e.g., 1194 for OpenVPN).
   - Save your settings.

4. **Test the Configuration**: Visit a website like "WhatIsMyIP.com" to verify that your browser traffic is now routed through your VPS.

By following these steps, only your browser traffic will be routed through the VPN on your VPS, while other applications on your computer will continue to use your regular internet connection.

ChatGPT
It seems like you don't have the `easy-rsa` command available on your system. `easy-rsa` is a separate package that provides a set of scripts to help set up a Certificate Authority (CA) for OpenVPN.

To resolve this issue, you'll need to install `easy-rsa` on your system. Here's how you can do it on Ubuntu/Debian-based systems:

1. Update your package index:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

2. Install `easy-rsa`:

```bash
sudo apt install easy-rsa
```

Once `easy-rsa` is installed, you should be able to run the `init-pki` command without any issues. If you're using a different Linux distribution, the installation steps might vary slightly, but you should still be able to install `easy-rsa` using your package manager.

After installing `easy-rsa`, you can then proceed with initializing the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for your OpenVPN setup by running `sudo easy-rsa init-pki` again.

ChatGPT
It seems that `easy-rsa` is already installed on your system, but the command is still not found. This could be due to the command not being in your system's PATH.

To resolve this, you can try the following steps:

1. **Locate the `easy-rsa` Directory**: First, you need to locate where `easy-rsa` is installed on your system. It's typically found in the `/usr/share/easy-rsa` directory.

2. **Add the Directory to Your PATH**: Once you've located the `easy-rsa` directory, you can add it to your PATH environment variable so that you can run the `easy-rsa` command from any location in your terminal.

   You can do this by adding the following line to your shell configuration file (such as `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.zshrc`):

   ```bash
   export PATH="$PATH:/usr/share/easy-rsa"
   ```

   Save the file and then run `source ~/.bashrc` (or the appropriate file for your shell) to apply the changes.

3. **Verify Installation**: After adding the directory to your PATH, you should be able to run the `easy-rsa` command without any issues. Try running `easy-rsa init-pki` again to verify.

If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

It seems like the `easy-rsa` command is still not being found after adding the directory to your PATH. Let's troubleshoot this further.

1. **Verify Location**: Ensure that `easy-rsa` is indeed installed in the directory `/usr/share/easy-rsa`. You can do this by checking the contents of the directory:

   ```bash
   ls /usr/share/easy-rsa
   ```

   If you see the `easy-rsa` scripts and files listed, then it's in the correct location.

2. **Check PATH**: Double-check that you've added the correct directory to your PATH. Open your `.bashrc` file again and confirm that the line you added is correct:

   ```bash
   export PATH="$PATH:/usr/share/easy-rsa"
   ```

   After making any changes, remember to save the file and then run `source ~/.bashrc` to apply the changes.

3. **Try Absolute Path**: As a workaround, you can try running `easy-rsa` using its absolute path. Instead of `sudo easy-rsa init-pki`, try:

   ```bash
   sudo /usr/share/easy-rsa/easyrsa init-pki
   ```

   This command explicitly specifies the full path to the `easyrsa` script.

If `easy-rsa` is indeed installed in `/usr/share/easy-rsa` and the PATH is correctly set, but you still encounter issues, there might be a different problem with your system configuration. Let me know if you need further assistance!

It appears that the `easyrsa` script is not directly available in the `/usr/share/easy-rsa/` directory. This could be due to changes in the directory structure or naming conventions.

Let's try running the `init-pki` command using the available scripts:

```bash
sudo /usr/share/easy-rsa/build-ca
```

This command should initialize the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for your OpenVPN setup. If you encounter any errors or need further assistance, please let me know!

ChatGPT
It seems that the `build-ca` script is trying to execute another script called `pkitool`, which is not found in the current directory. This could be due to changes in the script structure or missing dependencies.

To resolve this, you might need to manually initialize the PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) by running the necessary commands. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Initialize PKI**: Run the following commands to initialize the PKI manually:

   ```bash
   cd /usr/share/easy-rsa
   ./vars
   ./clean-all
   ./build-ca
   ```

   The `./vars` command initializes the environment variables, `./clean-all` cleans any existing PKI, and `./build-ca` builds the Certificate Authority (CA).

2. **Follow Prompts**: During the `build-ca` process, you'll be prompted to enter information for your CA certificate. Follow the prompts and provide the necessary information.

After running these commands, the PKI should be initialized, and you can proceed with setting up your OpenVPN server.

vps|/usr/share/easy-rsa $ source ./vars
**************************************************************
  No /usr/share/easy-rsa/openssl.cnf file could be found
  Further invocations will fail

ChatGPT
It seems that the `openssl.cnf` file is missing in the `/usr/share/easy-rsa/` directory. This file is necessary for the `easy-rsa` scripts to work properly, as it contains configuration options for OpenSSL.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. **Copy OpenSSL Configuration**: If you have OpenSSL installed on your system, you can copy its configuration file to the `easy-rsa` directory. Typically, the OpenSSL configuration file is located at `/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf`. You can copy it to the `easy-rsa` directory using the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo cp /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf /usr/share/easy-rsa/openssl.cnf
   ```

   This command copies the OpenSSL configuration file to the `easy-rsa` directory.

2. **Try Again**: After copying the `openssl.cnf` file, you can try running the `source ./vars` command again:

   ```bash
   source ./vars
   ```

   This command initializes the environment variables for `easy-rsa`.

3. **Proceed with Initialization**: Once the `vars` script is successfully sourced, you can proceed with initializing the PKI and building the CA as mentioned earlier:

   ```bash
   ./clean-all
   ./build-ca
   ```

   Follow the prompts and provide the necessary information during the CA certificate creation process.

After completing these steps, the `easy-rsa` should work as expected. If you encounter any further issues or have questions, please let me know!

ChatGPT
It seems that you're encountering an error when running the `./pkitool` script. This error indicates that there's a problem with the script itself, specifically with the `shift` command.

The `shift` command is typically used to shift positional parameters in a script, but it seems like it's being used incorrectly here.

To troubleshoot this issue, we'll need to examine the `pkitool` script and see what's causing the error. Since I don't have visibility into the contents of the `pkitool` script, I can't provide a specific solution without seeing its code.

However, based on the error message you provided, it seems like there may be a problem with how arguments are being processed or shifted within the script.

Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:

1. **Inspect the Script**: Open the `pkitool` script in a text editor and look for any lines that use the `shift` command. Verify that the usage of `shift` is correct and that it's being used with the appropriate number of arguments.

2. **Check for Updates**: If you obtained the `pkitool` script from a specific source, check for updates or newer versions. There may be a bug fix available that resolves the issue you're encountering.

3. **Search for Solutions**: Look online for any known issues or solutions related to the error message you're seeing. Other users may have encountered similar problems and posted solutions or workarounds.

4. **Consider Alternatives**: If you're unable to resolve the issue with `pkitool`, consider using an alternative method for generating certificates, such as the `easy-rsa` scripts provided by OpenVPN or other certificate management tools.

If you can provide more information about the `pkitool` script or any specific lines where the error occurs, I may be able to offer more targeted assistance.

how can i check my settings
ChatGPT
To check your settings after running `source ./vars` in the `easy-rsa` environment, you can use the `printenv` command to display the current environment variables. This will show you the values that have been set for the various fields used in generating certificates. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
printenv | grep KEY_
```

This command will display all environment variables that start with `KEY_`, which are the variables used to set certificate field values in the `easy-rsa` environment.

Alternatively, if you want to check the value of a specific variable, you can directly echo its value:

```bash
echo $KEY_COUNTRY
echo $KEY_PROVINCE
echo $KEY_CITY
echo $KEY_ORG
echo $KEY_EMAIL
echo $KEY_OU
echo $KEY_NAME
```

These commands will print out the values of each individual environment variable that you've set.

By checking these settings, you can ensure that the correct values are being used when generating certificates with `easy-rsa`. If any settings need to be adjusted, you can modify them in the `vars` file before generating certificates.
user
That all checked out Good WHat do I need to do next to get openvpn working ?
ChatGPT
Great! Now that your settings are all set up, the next steps involve using `easy-rsa` to generate the necessary certificates and keys for your OpenVPN setup. Here's a high-level overview of what you need to do:

1. **Generate the CA (Certificate Authority)**:
   - Run `./clean-all` to initialize the PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) directory.
   - Run `./build-ca` to generate the CA certificate and key pair.
   - Follow the prompts to enter information for your CA certificate.

2. **Generate Server Certificate and Key**:
   - Run `./build-key-server server` to generate the server certificate and key pair.
   - Follow the prompts and enter the necessary information when prompted.

3. **Generate Client Certificate and Key (Optional)**:
   - Run `./build-key client1` (replace `client1` with your desired client name) to generate a client certificate and key pair.
   - Repeat this step for each client you want to connect to the OpenVPN server.

4. **Generate Diffie-Hellman Parameters**:
   - Run `./build-dh` to generate Diffie-Hellman parameters. This step may take some time.

5. **Generate TLS-Auth Key (Optional)**:
   - Run `openvpn --genkey --secret keys/ta.key` to generate a TLS-Auth key for additional security. This step is optional but recommended.

6. **Copy Files to OpenVPN Configuration Directory**:
   - Copy the generated files (`ca.crt`, `server.crt`, `server.key`, `dh.pem`, and optionally `ta.key`) from the `keys` directory to your OpenVPN configuration directory.

7. **Configure OpenVPN Server**:
   - Edit your OpenVPN server configuration file (typically located in `/etc/openvpn/`) to point to the generated certificates and keys.
   - Configure other settings such as network settings, port, protocol, etc., according to your requirements.

8. **Start OpenVPN Server**:
   - Start the OpenVPN server using your system's init system (`systemctl` on systemd systems, `service` on SysV init systems).

9. **Configure Client Devices**:
   - On each client device, install the OpenVPN client software.
   - Copy the `ca.crt`, client `.crt`, and client `.key` files generated earlier to the client device.
   - Configure the OpenVPN client software to use the appropriate certificates and connect to the server.

10. **Test the Connection**:
    - Test the connection from each client device to ensure that they can connect to the OpenVPN server successfully.

These are the general steps for setting up OpenVPN using `easy-rsa`. The exact commands and file paths may vary depending on your specific setup and requirements. Make sure to refer to the OpenVPN documentation and any additional resources specific to your operating system and version for detailed instructions. Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance!

service on SysV init systems  Run as sudo ?
ChatGPT
Yes, when managing services on SysV init systems, such as older versions of Ubuntu or Debian, you typically need to run service-related commands with sudo privileges. This is because starting, stopping, and managing services often requires root-level permissions.

For example, to start the OpenVPN service on a SysV init system, you would use the `service` command with sudo:

```bash
sudo service openvpn start
```

Similarly, to stop the OpenVPN service, you would use:

```bash
sudo service openvpn stop
```

And to restart the service:

```bash
sudo service openvpn restart
```

In general, any service-related operation on a SysV init system should be prefixed with `sudo` to ensure proper permissions and access to system resources.

ChatGPT
The output of `sudo service openvpn status` indicates that the OpenVPN service is currently active but in an "exited" state. This typically means that the service has been started successfully but is not currently running any processes.

In the case of your system, the `openvpn.service` unit appears to be configured to run `/bin/true`, which is a command that does nothing and always returns success. This configuration would cause the OpenVPN service to start successfully but not actually run any OpenVPN processes.

To resolve this issue and start the OpenVPN service properly, you need to ensure that the `ExecStart` directive in the `openvpn.service` unit file points to the correct command to start the OpenVPN daemon.

You can edit the `openvpn.service` unit file to specify the correct `ExecStart` command. Once you've made the necessary changes, you can restart the OpenVPN service to apply the new configuration.

Here's a general example of what the `ExecStart` directive might look like in the `openvpn.service` unit file:

```
ExecStart=/usr/sbin/openvpn --config /path/to/your/openvpn.conf
```

Replace `/path/to/your/openvpn.conf` with the actual path to your OpenVPN configuration file.

After making changes to the `openvpn.service` unit file, you can restart the service with:

```bash
sudo service openvpn restart
```

This should properly start the OpenVPN service and allow clients to connect to it. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask!

what goes in here ?openvpn.conf
ChatGPT
The `openvpn.conf` file is the main configuration file for your OpenVPN server. It contains various settings that define how your OpenVPN server operates, including network settings, authentication methods, encryption settings, and more.

Here are some common settings that you might include in your `openvpn.conf` file:

1. **Port and Protocol**: Specify the port and protocol your OpenVPN server will listen on. For example:

   ```
   port 1194
   proto udp
   ```

2. **Server Mode**: Define whether your OpenVPN server will operate in `dev tun` (Layer 3 IP tunnel) or `dev tap` (Layer 2 Ethernet tunnel) mode. For example:

   ```
   dev tun
   ```

3. **Server Certificates and Keys**: Specify the paths to your server's certificate, key, and CA certificate files. For example:

   ```
   ca /etc/openvpn/keys/ca.crt
   cert /etc/openvpn/keys/server.crt
   key /etc/openvpn/keys/server.key
   ```

4. **DH Parameters**: Include the path to your Diffie-Hellman parameters file. For example:

   ```
   dh /etc/openvpn/keys/dh.pem
   ```

5. **TLS-Auth Key (Optional)**: If you generated a TLS-Auth key, include it in your configuration. For example:

   ```
   tls-auth /etc/openvpn/keys/ta.key 0
   ```

6. **Network Configuration**: Define the network settings for your VPN, including the IP address range for VPN clients. For example:

   ```
   server 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0
   ```

7. **Client Routing (Optional)**: If you want VPN clients to access other networks beyond the VPN server, you can push routes to them. For example:

   ```
   push "route 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0"
   ```

8. **Authentication and Encryption**: Specify the authentication and encryption settings for your VPN. For example:

   ```
   auth SHA256
   cipher AES-256-CBC
   ```

These are just a few examples of settings you might include in your `openvpn.conf` file. The exact configuration will depend on your specific requirements and network setup.

Once you've configured your `openvpn.conf` file, you can restart the OpenVPN service to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo service openvpn restart
```

Make sure to test your OpenVPN server to ensure that it's functioning as expected and that clients can connect to it successfully. If you have any specific requirements or questions about configuring your `openvpn.conf` file, feel free to ask!

set_var EASYRSA_ALGO "ec"
set_var EASYRSA_DIGEST "sha512"  
-bash: set_var: command not found
-bash: set_var: command not found

ChatGPT
It appears you're attempting to set environment variables in your shell script using a syntax that's not recognized. In bash scripts, you typically don't need to use the `set_var` command to set variables. Instead, you can directly assign values to variables.

For example, to set the `EASYRSA_ALGO` and `EASYRSA_DIGEST` variables, you can simply assign values to them like this:

```bash
EASYRSA_ALGO="ec"
EASYRSA_DIGEST="sha512"
```

If you're using these variables in an `easy-rsa` script, such as `vars`, you can place these lines directly in the script to set the variables.

Here's how you can modify your script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Set the algorithm and digest variables
EASYRSA_ALGO="ec"
EASYRSA_DIGEST="sha512"

# Export the variables (optional, depending on your use case)
export EASYRSA_ALGO
export EASYRSA_DIGEST

# Other commands in your script...
```

After modifying the script, you can run it as usual. This will set the `EASYRSA_ALGO` and `EASYRSA_DIGEST` variables to the specified values within the scope of the script. If you need these variables to be available in other scripts or shell sessions, you can use the `export` command to make them available in the environment.

ChatGPT
It seems like you're trying to use `easy-rsa` to generate a certificate request, but you're encountering some issues with the command.

The correct command to generate a certificate request using `easy-rsa` is `./easyrsa gen-req <name> nopass`, where `<name>` is the name you want to give to the certificate request.

Based on your directory listing, it looks like you're in the `/usr/share/easy-rsa` directory, where the `easyrsa` script is located. However, when you try to run `./easyrsa`, it's giving you a "No such file or directory" error, indicating that the script is not found.

It's possible that the `easyrsa` script does not have execute permissions. You can check and set the permissions using the following command:

```bash
chmod +x easyrsa
```

After setting the execute permission, you should be able to run the `easyrsa` command to generate the certificate request:

```bash
./easyrsa gen-req server nopass
```

This command will generate a certificate request for a server without a passphrase.

If you encounter any further issues or have questions, feel free to ask!

Thank you for providing the directory listing. It appears that the `easy-rsa` script is not included in the `/usr/share/easy-rsa` directory in your setup. Instead, the individual scripts for various tasks are available.

In this case, you'll need to use the individual scripts to perform the necessary actions. For example, to generate a certificate request, you would typically use the `build-key` script. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
cd /usr/share/easy-rsa
./build-key server
```

This command will generate a certificate request for a server with the name "server". You can replace "server" with your desired name if you prefer.

Similarly, for other tasks such as generating a Certificate Authority (CA) or generating Diffie-Hellman parameters, you would use the corresponding scripts (`build-ca`, `build-dh`, etc.).

If you have any specific tasks you need to accomplish with `easy-rsa`, please let me know, and I can provide further guidance on how to use the appropriate scripts for those tasks.

The `easy-rsa` directory contains various scripts for different tasks related to managing a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) for OpenSSL, which is commonly used for setting up Certificate Authorities (CAs) and generating certificates and keys.

Here's a brief explanation of each script:

1. `build-ca`: This script is used to build a Certificate Authority (CA). Running this script will generate the necessary files and directories for a CA, including the CA certificate and key.

2. `build-key`: This script is used to generate a key pair and certificate for a client or server. It's typically used to generate certificates for individual users or devices that will be connecting to your VPN server.

3. `build-dh`: This script is used to generate Diffie-Hellman parameters, which are used for key exchange during the TLS handshake process. Generating DH parameters is an important step in setting up a secure TLS connection.

4. `build-key-server`: Similar to `build-key`, but specifically for generating certificates for server authentication. This script is used to generate a server certificate and key pair.

5. `build-inter`: This script is used to build an intermediate Certificate Authority (CA). Intermediate CAs can be used to issue certificates on behalf of the root CA, providing an additional layer of security and delegation.

6. `clean-all`: This script is used to clean up the PKI directory by removing all generated files and directories. It's typically used to reset the PKI to a clean state before starting a new configuration.

7. `pkitool`: This script is used to generate certificate requests (CSRs) and sign them with the CA. It's a general-purpose tool for working with certificate requests and can be used in various scenarios.

8. `sign-req`: This script is used to sign certificate requests (CSRs) with the CA. It's typically used in conjunction with `pkitool` to sign certificate requests generated by clients or servers.

9. `revoke-full`: This script is used to revoke a certificate issued by the CA. It's used to invalidate a certificate in case it's compromised or no longer needed.

You don't necessarily need to run all of these scripts. Which scripts you need to run will depend on your specific requirements and the configuration of your PKI. Typically, you'll need to run `build-ca` to create a CA, `build-key-server` to generate a server certificate, and `build-key` to generate client certificates. You may also need to run `build-dh` to generate DH parameters for key exchange.

If you're setting up an OpenVPN server, for example, you'll need to run `build-ca`, `build-key-server`, and `build-dh`. Then, for each client device that will connect to the VPN, you'll need to run `build-key` to generate a client certificate.

It's important to carefully follow the instructions provided with `easy-rsa` and understand the purpose of each script before running them. Incorrectly configuring your PKI can lead to security vulnerabilities or connectivity issues. If you're unsure about any step, it's always a good idea to consult documentation or seek assistance from someone with experience in setting up PKIs.

It seems like you've listed the available scripts in the `easy-rsa` directory. Each of these scripts serves a specific purpose in managing a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) using `easy-rsa`. Here's a brief overview of each script:

1. `build-ca`: This script is used to build a Certificate Authority (CA). It generates the necessary files and directories for a CA, including the CA certificate and key.

2. `build-key-pass`: This script is similar to `build-key`, but it prompts for a passphrase to encrypt the private key.

3. `build-req-pass`: This script generates a certificate request (CSR) and prompts for a passphrase to encrypt the private key.

4. `build-inter`: This script is used to build an intermediate Certificate Authority (CA). Intermediate CAs can be used to issue certificates on behalf of the root CA.

5. `build-key-server`: This script is specifically used to generate certificates for servers. It generates a server certificate and key pair.

6. `build-key`: This script is used to generate certificates for clients or servers. It generates a key pair and certificate.

7. `build-req`: This script generates a certificate request (CSR) without a passphrase for the private key.

Depending on your specific requirements and the configuration of your PKI, you may need to run one or more of these scripts. Typically, you'll start by running `build-ca` to create a CA, then use `build-key` or `build-key-server` to generate certificates for clients and servers, respectively.

Make sure to follow any instructions or guidelines provided with `easy-rsa` and understand the purpose of each script before running them. If you're setting up a specific service, such as OpenVPN, there may be additional steps or requirements to consider.

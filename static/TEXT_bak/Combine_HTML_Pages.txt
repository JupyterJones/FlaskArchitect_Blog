Combine HTML Pages

join a directory of html pages into one page
ChatGPT
To join multiple HTML pages into one page, you can create a Python script that reads the content of each HTML file and appends it to a single output file. Here's a complete script to achieve this:

```python
import os
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

def join_html_pages(directory_path, output_file):
    """
    Join multiple HTML pages into one page.

    Args:
    - directory_path (str): The directory containing HTML pages.
    - output_file (str): The path to the output file where the combined HTML will be saved.
    """
    logging.info("Joining HTML pages...")
    try:
        with open(output_file, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as output:
            for filename in sorted(os.listdir(directory_path)):
                if filename.endswith('.html'):
                    logging.info(f"Reading file: {filename}")
                    with open(os.path.join(directory_path, filename), 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
                        output.write(f.read())
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    else:
        logging.info(f"HTML pages joined successfully. Output saved to: {output_file}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    directory_path = "/path/to/html/directory"
    output_file = "/path/to/output/combined_page.html"
    join_html_pages(directory_path, output_file)
```

Replace `/path/to/html/directory` with the path to the directory containing your HTML pages and `/path/to/output/combined_page.html` with the desired path for the combined HTML output file.

This script reads all `.html` files in the specified directory, appends their content to the output file, and saves the combined HTML. It logs information about the process, including any errors encountered.

Let me know if you need further assistance or modifications!

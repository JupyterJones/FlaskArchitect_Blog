ChatGPT
To pick 30 random files from the directory instead of the first 30 files, you can modify the line where the `files` variable is defined as follows:

```
files=$(ls -1 "${input_dir}"/*.jpg | shuf -n ${n_files})
```

This uses the `shuf` command to randomly select `n_files` number of files from the directory specified by `input_dir`. The `-1` option in `ls` ensures that each file is listed on a separate line, and the double quotes around `${input_dir}` ensure that the path is properly escaped in case it contains spaces or other special characters.

With this change, the script will select 30 random images from the directory instead of the first 30 images.

output_file="video.mp4"        I want to use a datetime in seconds for a filename.mp4
ChatGPT
To use the current date and time in seconds as the filename for the output video, you can replace the line `output_file="video.mp4"` with the following command:

```
output_file="$(date +%s).mp4"
```

This uses the `date` command with the `%s` format specifier, which returns the current time in seconds since the Unix epoch (January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC). The output of `date +%s` is then used as the filename for the output video with the `.mp4` extension.

input_dir="/mnt/HDD500/collections
ewdownloads/512x512"       I want to use the current directory   so I can run this script from /usr/local/bin     yet it will use whatever directory it is executed from
ChatGPT
To use the current directory as the input directory so that the script can be run from anywhere, you can replace the line `input_dir="/mnt/HDD500/collections
ewdownloads/512x512"` with the following command:

```
input_dir="$(pwd)"
```

This uses the `pwd` command to get the current working directory and sets the `input_dir` variable to the result. This way, the script will always use the directory from which it is executed as the input directory. 

Alternatively, you can use a command line argument to specify the input directory when running the script, like this:

```
input_dir="$1"
```

This sets the `input_dir` variable to the first argument passed to the script when it is run, which should be the path to the input directory. You can then run the script with:

```
$ ./script.sh /path/to/input/directory
```

This allows you to specify the input directory at runtime instead of hardcoding it in the script.

[swscaler @ 0x5578749d4400] deprecated pixel format used, make sure you did set range correctly   what does this mean ?
ChatGPT
The warning message "deprecated pixel format used, make sure you did set range correctly" is typically emitted by the `swscaler` filter in `ffmpeg`. It indicates that the input or output pixel format being used is no longer recommended and may cause issues, and that the user should ensure that the pixel range is set correctly.

In older versions of `ffmpeg`, the default pixel format was often set to `yuv420p`, which has a limited range of 16-235 for the Y component and 16-240 for the U and V components. However, some video sources may use the full range of 0-255 for all components, which can lead to incorrect colors and brightness levels when transcoding or scaling the video.

To avoid this issue, `ffmpeg` now defaults to the pixel format `yuv420p10le`, which supports the full range of 0-1023 for all components. However, if you are using an older version of `ffmpeg` or an input video with a limited range, you may still encounter this warning message.

To resolve the warning, you can try setting the pixel format explicitly using the `-pix_fmt` option, for example:

```
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -pix_fmt yuv420p10le -c:v libx264 output.mp4
```

This sets the output pixel format to `yuv420p10le`, which supports the full range of 0-1023. If you are using a different pixel format, you can try setting it explicitly instead.

If you are unsure about the correct pixel format to use for your video, you can use the `ffprobe` command to get information about the input video:

```
ffprobe input.mp4
```

This will display information about the input video, including the pixel format, color space, and chroma subsampling. You can use this information to set the correct pixel format when transcoding or scaling the video.
user
I am on Linux how can I check if yuv420p10le is available ?
ChatGPT
You can check if `yuv420p10le` is supported by your version of `ffmpeg` by running the following command:

```
ffmpeg -pix_fmts | grep yuv420p10le
```

This command lists all available pixel formats and pipes the output to `grep`, which searches for `yuv420p10le`. If `yuv420p10le` is supported, the command should return a line like this:

```
yuv420p10le      010    planar  10bpp
```

This indicates that `yuv420p10le` is supported and can be used as a pixel format.

If `yuv420p10le` is not supported, you may need to install a newer version of `ffmpeg` that supports this pixel format. You can also try using a different pixel format that is supported by your version of `ffmpeg`, such as `yuv420p` or `yuv444p`. You can list all available pixel formats using the `ffmpeg -pix_fmts` command.
user
ffmpeg -pix_fmts | grep yuv420p10le  >>>IO... yuv420p10le            3            15
ChatGPT
The output of the command `ffmpeg -pix_fmts | grep yuv420p10le` indicates that `yuv420p10le` is supported by your version of `ffmpeg`. The output shows `yuv420p10le` in the list of available pixel formats, with a value of `3` for its index and `15` for the number of bits per pixel.

You can therefore use `yuv420p10le` as a pixel format in your `ffmpeg` commands.

check the time mlocate is configured to run
ChatGPT
`mlocate` is a package that provides a faster alternative to the `locate` command for finding files on Linux systems. The default configuration for `mlocate` is to update its database of file locations once a day, typically using a cron job.

To check the time at which `mlocate` is configured to run on your system, you can look at the contents of the `/etc/cron.daily/mlocate` file. This file contains the command that updates the `mlocate` database, and it is usually scheduled to run once a day.

To view the contents of the `mlocate` cron job, you can use a command like this:

```
cat /etc/cron.daily/mlocate
```

This should display the command that is used to update the `mlocate` database, as well as any other configuration options that have been set for the cron job. The default command for `mlocate` is usually something like this:

```
/usr/bin/updatedb
```

This command updates the `mlocate` database by scanning the entire filesystem and creating an index of all files and directories. The process can take some time to complete, depending on the size of the filesystem and the number of files it contains.

I see no time ???
ChatGPT
You're correct, the contents of the `/etc/cron.daily/mlocate` file that you posted do not contain any explicit time specification. Instead, this file contains a script that updates the `mlocate` database, using various system utilities and configuration options.

However, as I mentioned earlier, the `mlocate` package is typically set up to run its database update once a day, using a cron job. This cron job is usually configured to run at a specific time of day, which can be adjusted by modifying the system's cron configuration.

To check the current configuration of the `mlocate` cron job on your system, you can look at the contents of the `/etc/crontab` file, as well as any files in the `/etc/cron.daily` directory that are related to `mlocate`. These files should contain the commands and options that are used to run the `updatedb.mlocate` script, including any scheduling information.

For example, the default `crontab` file on Ubuntu Linux systems includes a line like this:

```
17 *    * * *   root    cd / && run-parts --report /etc/cron.hourly
```

This line specifies that the system should run any scripts in the `/etc/cron.hourly` directory once per hour, at 17 minutes past the hour. If you see a similar line in your `crontab` file, it's possible that the `mlocate` cron job is scheduled to run at a similar time.

Note that the exact configuration of the `mlocate` cron job may vary depending on your Linux distribution and system configuration.

i can not find updatedb.mlocate
ChatGPT
If you are unable to find the `updatedb.mlocate` script on your system, it's possible that the `mlocate` package is not installed, or that it has been installed under a different name or location.

On some Linux distributions, the `mlocate` package may be installed as `locate` or `slocate`, and the database update script may have a different name, such as `updatedb` or `slocate.updatedb`.

To check if the `mlocate` package is installed on your system, you can use the package manager for your Linux distribution. For example, on Ubuntu and Debian-based systems, you can use the `apt` command:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mlocate
```

If the `mlocate` package is already installed, you can try searching for the `updatedb` script in the usual locations, such as `/usr/bin` or `/usr/sbin`. On some systems, the `updatedb` script may be located in a subdirectory of `/etc`, such as `/etc/cron.daily`.

If you still cannot find the `updatedb` script, you may need to consult the documentation or support resources for your specific Linux distribution or system.

I have it installed It runs at a very poor time, but I can not find the scedule or configure file 
ChatGPT
On some Linux distributions, the `mlocate` package is configured to run daily via a system cron job. The cron job is usually defined in a file under the `/etc/cron.daily` directory.

To see the current configuration for the `mlocate` cron job, you can check the contents of the `/etc/cron.daily/mlocate` file. This file should contain the command that runs the `updatedb.mlocate` script to update the search database.

You can also check the system-wide cron configuration to see if there are any other cron jobs that might be affecting the scheduling of the `mlocate` cron job. The system-wide cron configuration files are usually located in the `/etc/cron.d` directory.

If you need to change the scheduling of the `mlocate` cron job, you can edit the `/etc/cron.daily/mlocate` file to modify the command that runs the `updatedb.mlocate` script. You can also create a new cron job file in the `/etc/cron.d` directory to run the `updatedb.mlocate` script at a different interval.

Keep in mind that making changes to system cron jobs can affect the stability and performance of your system, so it's important to test any changes carefully and monitor the system for any unexpected behavior.

Where is the time ???
ChatGPT
The `/etc/cron.daily/mlocate` file you shared is a script that is run daily, but it does not specify a specific time for running. 

The `cron.daily` directory contains scripts that are executed once a day by the `cron` daemon. These scripts are usually run at a random time, determined by the system's `anacron` or `cron` configuration. 

To check the timing of the `cron.daily` scripts on your system, you can check the configuration files under `/etc/cron.*`. For example, you can check the `/etc/crontab` file or the `/etc/cron.d` directory to see if there are any rules that specify the timing of the `cron.daily` scripts.

it runs at 8:00am every morning It needs to be changed to 4:00 am
ChatGPT
You can edit the crontab file to change the schedule of the `mlocate` command. Here are the steps:

1. Open the crontab file for editing using the command:

   ```
   sudo crontab -e
   ```

2. Look for the line that schedules the `mlocate` command, which should be similar to:

   ```
   0 8 * * * /etc/cron.daily/mlocate
   ```

   This line means that the `mlocate` command runs at 8:00 am every day.

3. Replace the existing line with the following line to schedule the command at 4:00 am:

   ```
   0 4 * * * /etc/cron.daily/mlocate
   ```

   This line means that the `mlocate` command will run at 4:00 am every day.

4. Save the file and exit the editor.

After making this change, the `mlocate` command will run at 4:00 am every day.

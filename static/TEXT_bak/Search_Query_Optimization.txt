this returns same data no matter what the search term

It seems like you're encountering an issue where the search function returns the same data regardless of the search term provided. This could be due to how the SQL query is constructed or how the search terms are processed. Let's examine and fix the code:

```python
import sqlite3
import logging

# Setup logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

def search_multiWord(search_term):
    database_name = "your_database_name.db"  # Replace "your_database_name.db" with your actual database name
    conn = sqlite3.connect(database_name)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    SEARCH_DATA = []
    
    # Define the search terms
    search_terms = search_term.split()  # No need for " " in split, it splits by space by default
    
    logging.debug(f'search_terms: {search_terms}')
    
    # Construct the WHERE clause for the SQL query to filter rows based on all search terms
    where_clause = " AND ".join([f"user_ChatGPT_PAIR LIKE ?" for _ in search_terms])
    
    # Construct the parameterized values for the WHERE clause
    parameters = ['%' + term + '%' for term in search_terms]
    
    # Execute the SELECT query with the constructed WHERE clause and parameters
    rows = cursor.execute(f"SELECT ROWID,* FROM dialogue WHERE {where_clause} LIMIT 2", parameters)
    
    # Iterate over the resulting rows and format them as strings
    for row in rows:
        SEARCH_DATA.append(f"ROWID: {row[0]}\nUser: {row[1]}\nChatGPT: {row[2]}\n")
    
    # Close the connection
    conn.close()
    
    logging.debug(f'SEARCH_DATA: {SEARCH_DATA}')
    
    return SEARCH_DATA

# Example usage:
search_results = search_multiWord("search term example")
print(search_results)
```

Changes made:

1. Removed the unnecessary `logit` function and replaced it with Python's built-in `logging` module for logging.
2. Changed the split method to simply `split()`, as it splits by space by default.
3. Parameterized the query to avoid SQL injection and improve security.
4. Modified the way parameters are passed to the `execute` method to accommodate parameterized query.
5. Added debug logs to help with debugging.

This should resolve the issue with the search function returning the same data regardless of the search term provided. If you encounter any further issues or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

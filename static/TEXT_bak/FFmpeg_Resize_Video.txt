To resize a video using FFmpeg, you can use the `scale` filter. Here's an example command that resizes a video to a specific width and height:

```shell
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "scale=640:480" output.mp4
```

In this example, `input.mp4` is the input video file, and `output.mp4` is the resized output file. The `scale=640:480` option specifies the desired width and height of the output video. Adjust the values according to your needs.

If you want to preserve the aspect ratio of the original video and resize it to fit within specific dimensions, you can use the `scale` filter with the `force_original_aspect_ratio` option:

```shell
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf "scale=640:480:force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease" output.mp4
```

In this case, the `force_original_aspect_ratio=decrease` option ensures that the video's aspect ratio is maintained while resizing it to fit within the specified dimensions.

Note: FFmpeg is a command-line tool, and the above commands assume you have FFmpeg installed and available in your system's PATH. Adjust the file names and paths according to your specific setup.

It seems like you're encountering some errors while announcing files to various trackers. The log indicates that there are 24 errors for each announcement attempt. Without more context or the specific code you're using to interact with these trackers, it's a bit challenging to pinpoint the exact issue. However, based on the log, it appears that there might be a problem with the communication between your application and the trackers.

Here are some steps you could take to troubleshoot the issue:

1. **Check Network Connection**: Ensure that your server has a stable internet connection and can reach the tracker servers.

2. **Verify Tracker URLs**: Double-check that the URLs for the trackers are correct and that they are operational.

3. **Review Tracker Configuration**: Ensure that you are using the correct port and protocol (usually UDP or HTTP) for communicating with the trackers.

4. **Look for Authentication Issues**: Some trackers require authentication. Make sure you are providing any necessary credentials.

5. **Examine Error Messages**: If there are error messages accompanying the log entries, review them to see if they provide any clues about the issue.

6. **Check Tracker Status**: Verify if the trackers themselves are experiencing any issues or downtime.

7. **Logging and Debugging**: Consider adding more detailed logging and debugging information to your code to help pinpoint where the problem is occurring.

I am totally going a different way with my YouTube. I have done a lot of AI imagery manipulation, AI stories, And Slide and picture shows. The fact is almost everything is based on Python and Flask and I post videos I created with flask.  I am getting away from the AI stuff and getting into Flask and Python programming .

I'm sorry, but as an AI language model, I cannot directly perform actions on your computer or manipulate files. However, I can guide you on how to achieve the task you want to do.

It seems like you want to join a collection of GIF files (with the extension "*.gif") into a single video file named "GIFS.mp4." To do this, you'll need to use a video editing or conversion tool that supports GIF to MP4 conversion. You have a few options to accomplish this:

Option 1: Using FFmpeg (a powerful multimedia framework)

1. Download and install FFmpeg from the official website: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
2. Open a terminal or command prompt on your computer.
3. Navigate to the directory where your GIF files are located (e.g., Collection/).
4. Use the following command to concatenate the GIFs and create the MP4 file:

```bash
ffmpeg -f concat -i <(for f in *.gif; do echo "file '$PWD/$f'"; done) -c:v libx264 -pix_fmt yuv420p GIFS.mp4
```

Option 2: Using an online converter

If you prefer not to install software, you can use one of the many online converters available. Just search for "GIF to MP4 converter" in your favorite search engine, and you'll find several options. Upload the GIFs you want to join, and the website will convert them into a single MP4 file.

Remember to always be cautious when using online converters and make sure they are reputable and secure.

Whichever method you choose, ensure that you have all the rights and permissions to use the GIFs you are combining, especially if they are not your own creations.

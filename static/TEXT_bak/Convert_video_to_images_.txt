ffmpeg convert a 1 same image per frame start.mp4 to a ten different images per frame 10images.mp4
ChatGPT


To convert a video with 1 same image per frame to a video with 10 different images per frame using ffmpeg, you can use the `split` and `tile` filters. Here's an example command:

```
ffmpeg -i start.mp4 -vf "split=10[t1][t2];[t1]pad=iw:2*ih[t3];[t2]pad=iw:2*ih[t4];[t3][t4]tile=10x1" -c:a copy 10images.mp4
```

This command uses the `split` filter to split each input frame into 10 separate frames, and then the `pad` filter to create a canvas that's twice as tall as the input frame. The `tile` filter is then used to tile the 10 frames horizontally across the canvas.

The resulting video, `10images.mp4`, will have 10 different images per frame. Note that this will only work if the input video has a constant frame rate. If the frame rate varies, you'll need to add a `setpts` filter to ensure that each frame is duplicated the correct number of times.

my current video start.mp4 show one image (the same image) per second  I want to show 5 different images per second 5images.mp4

To convert a video with one image per second to a video with five different images per second using FFmpeg, you can use the `setpts` and `select` filters. Here's an example command:

```
ffmpeg -i start.mp4 -vf "setpts=0.2*PTS,select='not(mod(n\,5))'" -an 5images.mp4
```

This command uses the `setpts` filter to speed up the video by a factor of 5 (i.e., 1/5th of the original duration) and the `select` filter to keep only every 5th frame. The `not(mod(n\,5))` expression in the `select` filter selects only the frames whose index `n` is a multiple of 5, effectively discarding the intermediate frames.

Note that we're discarding the audio using `-an` since we're not changing the audio in any way. If you want to keep the audio, you can remove this option.

The resulting video, `5images.mp4`, will have five different images per second. You can adjust the speedup factor and the `mod` parameter in the `select` filter to change the number of images per second to any desired value.

tomany images I want 6 per frame

To convert a video with one image per frame to a video with six images per frame using FFmpeg, you can modify the command we used earlier. Here's an example command that will split each frame into six images and tile them in two rows of three:

```
ffmpeg -i start.mp4 -vf "split=6[t1][t2][t3][t4][t5][t6];[t1][t2][t3][t4][t5][t6]xstack=inputs=6:layout=0_0|w0_0|2w0_0|0_h0|w0_h0|2w0_h0" -c:a copy 6images.mp4
```

This command uses the `split` filter to split each input frame into six separate frames, and then the `xstack` filter to tile the six frames into two rows of three.

Note that we use the `inputs=6` option to specify the number of input streams to stack and the `layout` option to specify the position of each input stream in the output. The `w0` and `h0` parameters represent the width and height of the first input stream, respectively.

The resulting video, `6images.mp4`, will have six different images per frame arranged in two rows of three.

To run the Firefox browser using the `subprocess` module in Python and open a specific HTML file, you can use the following code:

```python
import subprocess

file_path = '/mnt/HDD500/FLASK/static/milestones_resources/comments/results.html'
subprocess.run(['firefox', file_path])
```

This code utilizes the `subprocess.run()` function to execute the Firefox browser with the specified file path as an argument. The `file_path` variable should contain the absolute path to the HTML file you want to open.

Make sure that Firefox is installed on your system and that it is included in the system's PATH environment variable so that the `firefox` command can be recognized and executed by `subprocess.run()`.

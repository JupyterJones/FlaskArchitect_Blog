If you want to add a large file to your GitHub repository, you can follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Git installed on your local machine and have a Git repository set up.

2. Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the local repository's directory.

3. If the large file is already in the repository's directory, you can skip this step. Otherwise, copy the large file into the repository's directory.

4. Stage the file by running the following command:
   ```
   git add <file_name>
   ```
   Replace `<file_name>` with the actual name of your large file.

5. Commit the staged file with a descriptive message using the following command:
   ```
   git commit -m "Add large file"
   ```

6. Upload the file to the GitHub repository using the following command:
   ```
   git push origin <branch_name>
   ```
   Replace `<branch_name>` with the name of the branch you want to push the file to, typically "main" or "master".

Note that GitHub has a file size limit of 100 MB for free accounts. If your file exceeds this limit, you'll need to consider using Git Large File Storage (Git LFS) or other alternatives to manage and store large files separately.

I would not have used the term large file unless it was large above the limit.   Ho do I upload a 450mg file

If your file exceeds the GitHub file size limit of 100 MB, you'll need to use Git Large File Storage (Git LFS) to upload the file to your repository. Here's how you can do it:

1. Install Git LFS on your local machine by following the instructions in the Git LFS documentation: https://git-lfs.github.com/

2. Once Git LFS is installed, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to your local repository's directory.

3. Initialize Git LFS in your repository by running the following command:
   ```
   git lfs install
   ```

4. Track the large file using Git LFS by running the following command:
   ```
   git lfs track "<file_name>"
   ```
   Replace `<file_name>` with the actual name of your large file.

5. Stage and commit the changes to your repository. Use the regular Git commands:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add large file using Git LFS"
   ```

6. Push the changes to the remote repository:
   ```
   git push origin <branch_name>
   ```
   Replace `<branch_name>` with the name of the branch you want to push the file to, typically "main" or "master".

7. GitHub will automatically detect that you're using Git LFS for tracking large files and handle the upload accordingly.

Please note that Git LFS uses a separate storage system for large files, so your actual repository size won't increase by the full size of the large file. Git LFS stores references to the large file instead.

what is markdowns equivalent of <pre>
ChatGPT
In Markdown, the equivalent of the HTML `<pre>` element is a code block. Code blocks allow you to display preformatted text or code snippets in a visually distinct manner. To create a code block in Markdown, you can use triple backticks (\```) or tildes (\~~~) before and after the block. Here's an example:

<pre>
```
This is a code block.
It preserves line breaks and whitespace.
```
</pre>

You can also specify the programming language after the opening triple backticks to enable syntax highlighting. For example, to create a code block with JavaScript syntax highlighting:

<pre>
```javascript
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```
</pre>

Using code blocks in Markdown allows you to present code snippets or any other preformatted text in a visually appealing and readable way.

Flask Open & View Text

Flask open and view a *.txt from static/text/*.txt
ChatGPT
To open and view a `.txt` file located in the `static/text/` directory using Flask, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a `static` directory in your Flask project if it doesn't already exist.
2. Inside the `static` directory, create a `text` directory.
3. Place your `example.txt` file inside the `text` directory (`static/text/example.txt`).
4. In your Flask application's main file (e.g., `app.py`), import the necessary modules:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template
```

5. Create a Flask application instance:

```python
app = Flask(__name__)
```

6. Define a route that handles the request to view the text file:

```python
@app.route('/view_text')
def view_text():
    text_file_path = 'static/text/example.txt'
    with open(text_file_path, 'r') as file:
        file_contents = file.read()
    return render_template('view_text.html', file_contents=file_contents)
```

In this example, the route `/view_text` is defined. When a user accesses this URL, the `example.txt` file will be opened, its contents will be read, and the contents will be passed to the `view_text.html` template.

7. Create a template file named `view_text.html` in a `templates` directory (if it doesn't exist already) alongside your main Flask file.

8. In the `view_text.html` template, display the file contents:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>View Text File</title>
</head>
<body>
    <pre>{{ file_contents }}</pre>
</body>
</html>
```

The `<pre>` tag is used to preserve the formatting of the text file when displaying it on the web page.

9. Finally, start the Flask development server:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

Now, when you run your Flask application and access the `/view_text` route, it will open the `example.txt` file and display its contents in a web browser. Remember to replace `example.txt` with the actual name of your text file.

    with open(text_file_path, 'r') as file:
        file_contents = file.read()
    return render_template('view_text.html', file_contents=file_contents)                        I want to select the file i wish to view in static/text/

If you want to dynamically select the file you wish to view from the `static/text/` directory, you can modify the code to accept a filename as a parameter in the URL. Here's an updated version:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/view_text/<filename>')
def view_text(filename):
    text_file_path = f'static/text/{filename}.txt'
    try:
        with open(text_file_path, 'r') as file:
            file_contents = file.read()
        return render_template('view_text.html', file_contents=file_contents)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return f'Text file {filename} not found.'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

In this version, the route `/view_text/<filename>` is defined, where `<filename>` is a placeholder for the actual name of the text file. The `filename` parameter is then used to construct the path to the text file.

If the file is found, its contents will be read and passed to the `view_text.html` template. If the file is not found, a simple error message will be returned.

Now you can access different text files by specifying their filenames in the URL, such as `/view_text/example` to view `static/text/example.txt`. Make sure to remove the file extension (`.txt`) from the URL parameter.

werkzeug.routing.exceptions.BuildError: Could not build url for endpoint 'view_text'. Did you forget to specify values ['filename']?
ChatGPT
I apologize for the error. It seems that the `view_text` route expects a `filename` parameter, but it is not being provided when generating the URL. To resolve this issue, you need to update the code where the URL is generated. Here's an updated version:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/view_text/<filename>')
def view_text(filename):
    text_file_path = f'static/text/{filename}.txt'
    try:
        with open(text_file_path, 'r') as file:
            file_contents = file.read()
        return render_template('view_text.html', file_contents=file_contents)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return f'Text file {filename} not found.'

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

Now, when you generate the URL for the `view_text` endpoint, make sure to provide the `filename` value. For example, if you want to view the file `example.txt`, you would generate the URL as follows:

```python
url = url_for('view_text', filename='example')
```

Replace `'example'` with the actual filename you want to view.

No hard coded filename I want to select from a list of files in static/text/*/txt
ChatGPT
If you want to select a file from a list of files in the `static/text/` directory, you can modify the code to retrieve the list of files dynamically and provide a selection mechanism. Here's an updated version:

```python
import os
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/view_text')
def view_text():
    text_files_dir = 'static/text/'
    text_files = []
    
    # Retrieve list of text files in the directory
    for filename in os.listdir(text_files_dir):
        if filename.endswith('.txt'):
            text_files.append(filename)
    
    return render_template('select_file.html', text_files=text_files)


@app.route('/view_text/<filename>')
def display_text(filename):
    text_file_path = f'static/text/{filename}'
    try:
        with open(text_file_path, 'r') as file:
            file_contents = file.read()
        return render_template('view_text.html', file_contents=file_contents, filename=filename)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return f'Text file {filename} not found.'


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```

In this updated code, we have two routes. 

The first route, `/view_text`, retrieves the list of text files in the `static/text/` directory and passes the list to a template called `select_file.html`. This template will provide a selection mechanism for the user to choose a file.

The second route, `/view_text/<filename>`, takes the selected filename as a parameter and displays the contents of that file. The file path is constructed based on the selected filename, and the file contents are passed to the `view_text.html` template along with the filename.

Now, you need to create the `select_file.html` and `view_text.html` templates.

Here's an example `select_file.html` template:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Select a Text File</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Select a Text File</h1>
    <ul>
        {% for filename in text_files %}
        <li><a href="{{ url_for('display_text', filename=filename) }}">{{ filename }}</a></li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

And here's an example `view_text.html` template:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>View Text File</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Viewing Text File: {{ filename }}</h1>
    <pre>{{ file_contents }}</pre>
</body>
</html>
```

Now, when you access the `/view_text` route, you will see a list of text files in the `static/text/` directory. Clicking on a filename will take you to the `/view_text/<filename>` route, where the selected file's contents will be displayed.

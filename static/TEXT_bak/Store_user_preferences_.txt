ChatGPT


This is a set of instructions that describes how to implement a user story that states the desire to store user preferences, and retrieve them in the future. The implementation involves creating an AWS Lambda function with an API Gateway trigger to store user preferences in a MySQL database, and then deploying the function to AWS Lambda.

Here are the steps involved:

1. Create an AWS Lambda function with a trigger of API Gateway at the route /dev/dad-lambda.

This step involves creating an AWS Lambda function that is triggered by an API Gateway endpoint. The endpoint should be set to /dev/dad-lambda, which will allow users to interact with the Lambda function through a web API.

2. Spin up a MySQL Docker container and create a table locally to store user preferences. Make a note of the table creation statement.

This step involves creating a MySQL database and table to store user preferences. A Docker container can be used to create the MySQL database. The table creation statement should be noted for future reference.

3. Write an AWS Lambda handler that connects to MySQL and stores user preference data in it.

This step involves writing the code for the AWS Lambda function. The function should connect to the MySQL database and store user preference data in the created table.

4. Write unit tests.

This step involves writing unit tests to ensure that the Lambda function is working as expected. The tests should cover various scenarios, such as storing user preferences with different values.

5. Deploy the function to Lambda.

This step involves deploying the Lambda function to AWS Lambda. The deployment should be done using the AWS CLI or the AWS console.

6. Create the RDBMS to store the data in AWS Services.

This step involves creating the RDBMS (Relational Database Management System) to store the data in AWS services. Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) can be used for this purpose.

7. Test functionality as a public endpoint using Postman (QA testing)

This step involves testing the functionality of the Lambda function as a public endpoint using Postman, a popular API testing tool. The testing should ensure that the function is working correctly and returning the expected results. The success response should have a status code, a boolean success flag and an empty data field.

Finally, the request body should have a UserPreferences type, which consists of a superUser boolean value and a colorTheme enum with values of either "dark" or "light".

how do I accomplish this I am connected to my docker container
ChatGPT
To accomplish the tasks outlined in the instructions, while you're connected to your MySQL Docker container, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a MySQL database and table to store user preferences. You can use the following commands to create a database and a table with the required columns:

```mysql
CREATE DATABASE user_preferences;
USE user_preferences;

CREATE TABLE preferences (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  superUser BOOLEAN,
  colorTheme ENUM('dark', 'light'),
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

2. Write the AWS Lambda function to connect to MySQL and store user preferences data in the created table. You can use any programming language supported by AWS Lambda and a MySQL connector library. Here's an example of a Node.js Lambda function that accomplishes the task:

```javascript
const mysql = require('mysql');
const pool  = mysql.createPool({
  connectionLimit : 10,
  host            : 'localhost',
  user            : 'root',
  password        : 'password',
  database        : 'user_preferences'
});

exports.handler = async (event) => {
    const preferences = JSON.parse(event.body);
    const { superUser, colorTheme } = preferences;
    const query = 'INSERT INTO preferences (superUser, colorTheme) VALUES (?, ?)';
    const inserts = [superUser, colorTheme];
    const sql = mysql.format(query, inserts);
    
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        pool.query(sql, (error, results, fields) => {
            if (error) {
                console.error(error);
                return reject(error);
            }
            console.log(results);
            return resolve({
                statusCode: 200,
                body: JSON.stringify({
                    success: true,
                    data: {},
                }),
            });
        });
    });
};
```

This code listens for incoming requests, parses the incoming JSON payload to extract the `superUser` and `colorTheme` fields, inserts the data into the MySQL table using a prepared statement to avoid SQL injection attacks, and returns a success response with an empty data field.

3. Write unit tests. You can use a unit testing framework like Jest or Mocha to write tests that ensure the Lambda function works as expected. Here's an example Jest test:

```javascript
const { handler } = require('./index.js');

describe('handler', () => {
    test('stores user preferences in MySQL table', async () => {
        const preferences = {
            superUser: true,
            colorTheme: 'dark',
        };
        const event = {
            body: JSON.stringify(preferences),
        };
        const response = await handler(event);
        expect(response.statusCode).toBe(200);
        expect(JSON.parse(response.body)).toEqual({
            success: true,
            data: {},
        });
    });
});
```

4. Deploy the function to AWS Lambda. You can use the AWS CLI to create and deploy the Lambda function. Here's an example command that creates the function:

```bash
aws lambda create-function \
    --function-name dad-lambda \
    --runtime nodejs14.x \
    --role arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/service-role/lambda-execution-role \
    --handler index.handler \
    --zip-file fileb://./function.zip \
    --region us-east-1
```

Make sure to replace `123456789012` with your actual AWS account ID and `./function.zip` with the path to your deployment package.

5. Create the RDBMS to store the data in AWS Services. You can use Amazon RDS to create a MySQL database instance in AWS. Here's an example command that creates a MySQL instance:

```bash
aws rds create-db-instance \
    --db-instance-identifier mydbinstance
user
how do I insert data  superuser 1  and colorTheme "dark"
ChatGPT
To insert data into the `preferences` table in MySQL with a `superUser` value of 1 and a `colorTheme` value of "dark", you can use the following SQL query:

```mysql
INSERT INTO preferences (superUser, colorTheme) VALUES (1, 'dark');
```

This will insert a new row into the `preferences` table with a `superUser` value of 1 and a `colorTheme` value of "dark". You can modify the values in the query to insert different data.
user
is this :                                                          const mysql = require('mysql');
const pool  = mysql.createPool({
  connectionLimit : 10,
  host            : 'localhost',
  user            : 'root',
  password        : 'password',
  database        : 'user_preferences'
});

exports.handler = async (event) => {
    const preferences = JSON.parse(event.body);
    const { superUser, colorTheme } = preferences;
    const query = 'INSERT INTO preferences (superUser, colorTheme) VALUES (?, ?)';
    const inserts = [superUser, colorTheme];
    const sql = mysql.format(query, inserts);
    
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        pool.query(sql, (error, results, fields) => {
            if (error) {
                console.error(error);
                return reject(error);
            }
            console.log(results);
            return resolve({
                statusCode: 200,
                body: JSON.stringify({
                    success: true,
                    data: {},
                }),
            });
        });
    });
};
the file index.js?
ChatGPT
Yes, that code block looks like it could be the index.js file for your AWS Lambda function that will store user preferences in MySQL. 

This code block creates a MySQL connection pool using the `mysql` module, then defines an AWS Lambda function handler that parses the request body for user preferences and inserts them into the `preferences` table using a prepared SQL statement.

You can modify the code to fit your specific requirements, such as changing the name of the `preferences` table, or adding more fields to the `UserPreferences` type.

how do i test with Postman
ChatGPT
To test your Lambda function with Postman, you can follow these steps:

1. Open Postman and create a new request with a POST method.
2. Set the request URL to the API Gateway endpoint for your Lambda function, which in this case is likely `https://{api-gateway-endpoint}/dev/dad-lambda`.
3. In the Headers tab, add a `Content-Type` header with a value of `application/json`.
4. In the Body tab, select the "raw" option and enter a JSON object with the user preferences you want to store, like this:

```
{
  "superUser": true,
  "colorTheme": "dark"
}
```

5. Click the Send button to send the request to your Lambda function. If the request is successful, you should receive a response with a 200 status code and a JSON object like this:

```
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {},
  "statusCode": 200
}
```

This indicates that the user preferences were successfully stored in your MySQL database. You can verify this by querying the database directly or by creating a separate Lambda function to retrieve the data and returning it as a response to a GET request.
user
Open Postman and create a new request with a POST method    I dont even know what Postman is 
ChatGPT
Postman is a popular tool for testing APIs. It allows you to send HTTP requests and receive responses, making it a great tool for testing API endpoints.

To use Postman, you first need to download and install it from the Postman website. Once you have Postman installed, you can follow the steps I provided in my previous message to create a new request and test your Lambda function.

Here's a brief overview of how to create a new request in Postman:

1. Open Postman and click the "New" button in the top left corner.
2. In the "Create New" dialog box, select "Request".
3. In the "New Request" dialog box, give your request a name and select "POST" as the HTTP method.
4. Enter the URL for your API Gateway endpoint in the "Enter request URL" field.
5. Add any necessary headers or body data to the request.
6. Click the "Send" button to send the request to your API Gateway endpoint.

You should then receive a response from your Lambda function, which you can view in the "Body" tab of the Postman app.

    SyntaxError: Cannot use import statement outside a module

ChatGPT
This error message suggests that you're trying to use an ES6 `import` statement in a JavaScript file that isn't set up to handle them. 

To fix this error, you have a few options:

1. Change the `import` statement to a CommonJS `require` statement. For example:

```
const { handler } = require('./index');
```

2. Update your project to use a build tool like Babel that can handle ES6 imports. This would require some additional setup and configuration.

3. Update your project to use the `esm` module loader, which allows you to use ES6 imports in Node.js. You can install the `esm` module from npm, and then use it to run your code like this:

```
node -r esm index.js
```

This would require you to update your `package.json` file to include a script that runs your code with the `esm` loader.

I hope this helps!

how do i setup ssh for two different git accounts
ChatGPT
To use two different Git accounts with SSH, you need to configure SSH to use different keys for each account. Here's a general outline of the steps you can take:

1. Generate SSH keys for each account using the `ssh-keygen` command. Make sure to use different names for the key files, and optionally add a passphrase for each key.

2. Add the public key for each account to the corresponding Git hosting service (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, etc.). You can usually do this by copying the contents of the `.pub` file generated by `ssh-keygen` and pasting it into the SSH keys section of your account settings on the hosting service's website.

3. Create a `config` file in your SSH directory (`~/.ssh/` on Unix-based systems) with the following contents:

```
# Default GitHub account
Host github.com
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa

# Second GitHub account
Host github-second-account
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/second-account-key
```

This config file specifies two different "hosts" for SSH to use when connecting to GitHub. The first one is the default `github.com` host, which uses the default `id_rsa` key. The second one is a custom host that we've named `github-second-account`, which uses a different key file called `second-account-key`.

4. Update the URLs of your Git repositories to use the custom hostname you defined in the `config` file. For example, if you want to clone a repository using the second account, you would use a URL like this:

```
git clone git@github-second-account:username/repo.git
```

This tells Git to use the custom `github-second-account` host defined in the `config` file, which in turn uses the `second-account-key` key file.

That should be it! You should now be able to use two different Git accounts with SSH.
user
so they can both use the same key I just cp 1st account key to second account key ?
ChatGPT
No, you should not use the same SSH key for multiple accounts. Each account should have its own unique SSH key.

If you need to use the same computer for multiple Git accounts, you can create separate SSH key pairs for each account, as I outlined in my previous response. Each SSH key pair consists of a private key and a corresponding public key. You can keep the private keys in your `~/.ssh` directory, and add the corresponding public keys to the authorized keys list for each account on the Git hosting service.

Then, you can configure your `~/.ssh/config` file to use the appropriate SSH key for each Git repository. This allows you to authenticate with the correct Git account when you interact with the repositories.

Copying one SSH key to another account's key would compromise the security of both accounts, as anyone with access to the shared key would have access to both accounts.
user
what should my ssh config file be named ?
ChatGPT
The SSH config file should be named `config` and located in the `~/.ssh` directory. If the file does not exist, you can create it by running `touch ~/.ssh/config` in the terminal.

Note that the file name is case sensitive, so make sure to use lowercase letters for "config".

git clone git@github.com:JenniferNorthrup/dad-lambda.git     USING my BlogBlocks account
ChatGPT
To clone the `dad-lambda` repository using your BlogBlocks GitHub account, you will need to:

1. Make sure you have your SSH key set up correctly for your BlogBlocks account.

2. Go to the `dad-lambda` repository on GitHub.

3. Click the green "Code" button and select "SSH" to get the SSH URL for the repository.

4. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

5. Run the following command in the terminal:

```
git clone git@github.com:JenniferNorthrup/dad-lambda.git
```

This will clone the repository to your local machine. If you encounter any issues with authentication or access, you may need to check your SSH key configuration or verify that you have the necessary permissions on the GitHub repository.
user
BlogBlocks has access to this account my other account JupyterJones does not  How to I ssh clone with BlogBlocks
ChatGPT
If you want to clone the `dad-lambda` repository using your BlogBlocks account, you will need to add the SSH key associated with your BlogBlocks account to your `ssh-agent` and use the corresponding email address for the Git configuration.

Here are the steps you can follow to clone the repository:

1. Make sure the SSH key associated with your BlogBlocks account is added to your `ssh-agent`. You can check if the key is added by running the command `ssh-add -l`. If the key is not listed, you can add it by running `ssh-add ~/.ssh/blogblocks_key` (replace `blogblocks_key` with the actual name of your private key file).

2. Set the email address associated with your BlogBlocks account in Git by running the following commands:

```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your_email@blogblocks.com"
```

Replace "Your Name" with your actual name and "your_email@blogblocks.com" with your actual email address associated with your BlogBlocks account.

3. Go to the `dad-lambda` repository on GitHub.

4. Click the green "Code" button and select "SSH" to get the SSH URL for the repository.

5. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

6. Run the following command in the terminal:

```
git clone git@github.com:JenniferNorthrup/dad-lambda.git
```

This will clone the repository to your local machine using your BlogBlocks account. If you encounter any issues with authentication or access, you may need to check your SSH key configuration or verify that you have the necessary permissions on the GitHub repository.

ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/jack/.ssh/id_rsa): blogblocks
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in blogblocks
Your public key has been saved in blogblocks.pub
I do not see blogblocks.pub  in my .ssh  ??
ChatGPT
By default, when you run `ssh-keygen` without specifying a file name, it will create the key pair with the default name `id_rsa` for the private key and `id_rsa.pub` for the public key, and save them in the `~/.ssh` directory.

In your case, you specified `blogblocks` as the file name for the key pair, so the private key should be saved in `~/.ssh/blogblocks`, and the public key should be saved in `~/.ssh/blogblocks.pub`.

If you do not see the `blogblocks.pub` file in your `~/.ssh` directory, it is possible that the key pair was not generated successfully or that it was saved in a different location.

You can check the contents of your `~/.ssh` directory by running the command `ls -al ~/.ssh` to see if the `blogblocks` files are present. If they are not, you can try running `ssh-keygen` again and specifying the file name as `~/.ssh/blogblocks` to make sure the files are saved in the correct location.

If you still have issues generating the key pair, you may want to check your permissions on the `~/.ssh` directory or consult the SSH documentation for your operating system.
user
I see the keys, But when I get clone it uses the wrong account
ChatGPT
When you run `git clone` using the SSH URL, Git will try to authenticate using the available SSH keys on your local machine. It will use the default SSH key (`id_rsa` and `id_rsa.pub`) unless you specify a different key explicitly.

In your case, it seems that Git is using the default key associated with your JupyterJones account instead of the newly generated key for your BlogBlocks account.

To ensure that Git uses the correct key when authenticating with the Git server, you can add the key to your SSH agent using the `ssh-add` command. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Ensure that your SSH key is located in the `~/.ssh` directory with the correct file name (`blogblocks` and `blogblocks.pub` in your case).

2. Run the following command to start the SSH agent: 

   ```
   eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
   ```

3. Add your private key to the SSH agent by running:

   ```
   ssh-add ~/.ssh/blogblocks
   ```

4. Verify that the key has been added by running:

   ```
   ssh-add -l
   ```

   This should show the fingerprint of the added key.

5. Try cloning the Git repository again using the SSH URL, and Git should use the key associated with your BlogBlocks account.

If you have multiple keys, you can use the `ssh-add` command to add them all to the SSH agent, and Git will try them in order until one works.
user
Enter passphrase for key '/home/jack/.ssh/id_ed25519':  it will not ask for blogblocks ??
ChatGPT
When you add an SSH key to the SSH agent using the `ssh-add` command, it will prompt you for the passphrase only once, regardless of how many times you use the key afterwards. This is because the SSH agent stores the decrypted key in memory and uses it to authenticate subsequent SSH connections without prompting for the passphrase again.

So, if you have already added the `blogblocks` key to the SSH agent using `ssh-add`, it will not prompt you for the passphrase again when you try to clone the Git repository using the SSH URL. It will use the key that is currently stored in the SSH agent's memory, which should be the `blogblocks` key in your case.
user
it still asks for /home/jack/.ssh/id_ed25519     not blogblocks
ChatGPT
If it's still asking for the passphrase for the `id_ed25519` key instead of the `blogblocks` key, it could be because the `id_ed25519` key is the default key that is used by the SSH client when it tries to authenticate with a remote server using SSH. 

To make sure that the SSH client uses the `blogblocks` key instead of the `id_ed25519` key, you can add the following lines to your `~/.ssh/config` file:

```
Host github.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/blogblocks
```

This tells the SSH client to use the `blogblocks` key when connecting to `github.com` via SSH. Make sure to replace `github.com` with the actual hostname of the Git server you're trying to connect to.

After adding this configuration, try cloning the Git repository again and it should use the `blogblocks` key instead of the `id_ed25519` key.
user
I use two accounts.     How do i choose which one I use for got clone
ChatGPT
To choose which SSH key to use when cloning a Git repository, you can specify the key file explicitly using the `ssh-add` command before running the `git clone` command. Here are the steps:

1. Add the SSH key you want to use to the SSH agent by running:

```
ssh-add ~/.ssh/blogblocks
```

This will add the `blogblocks` key to the SSH agent and prompt you for the passphrase.

2. Run the `git clone` command as usual, but use the SSH URL that corresponds to the Git account you want to use, for example:

```
git clone git@github.com:BlogBlocks/my-repo.git
```

This will use the `blogblocks` SSH key to authenticate with GitHub and clone the `my-repo` repository associated with the `BlogBlocks` account.

If you need to switch between accounts frequently, you can also create a separate SSH configuration file for each account and specify the configuration file to use using the `ssh` command's `-F` option. For example:

```
ssh -F ~/.ssh/config-blogblocks git@github.com:BlogBlocks/my-repo.git
```

This will use the `config-blogblocks` configuration file in the `~/.ssh` directory instead of the default `config` file, which can contain the specific settings for the `BlogBlocks` account.
user
I use two accounts how do I switch which one I use ?
ChatGPT
To switch between multiple Git accounts on your local machine, you can use the following steps:

1. Generate a new SSH key for the second Git account using the `ssh-keygen` command and save it with a different name and location than the first key. For example, you can save it as `blogblocks` in the `~/.ssh/` directory.

2. Add the new SSH key to your second Git account on the provider's website, similar to how you did for the first account.

3. Create a new SSH configuration file or modify the existing one to include the configuration for the new SSH key. You can do this by editing the `~/.ssh/config` file and adding a new configuration block like the following:

```
# Git account for BlogBlocks
Host github.com-blogblocks
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/blogblocks

```

4. Update the Git remote URL for the repository you want to use with the second account to include the `Host` parameter from the SSH configuration file. You can do this by running the following command:

```
git remote set-url origin git@github.com-blogblocks:JenniferNorthrup/dad-lambda.git
```

This command updates the Git remote URL for the `origin` remote to use the `github.com-blogblocks` Host parameter from the SSH configuration file.

5. Now you can use `git clone`, `git push`, and other Git commands as usual and they will use the SSH key and configuration associated with the selected Git account. To switch between accounts, you can modify the SSH configuration file and update the Git remote URL as described above.
user
Enter passphrase for key '/home/jack/.ssh/id_ed25519':  how do I remove 
ChatGPT
If you want to remove the passphrase from your SSH key, you can use the following command:

```
ssh-keygen -p -f /path/to/your/key
```

This command will prompt you to enter the old passphrase, then it will give you the option to set a new passphrase or leave it blank to remove the passphrase.

Alternatively, you can use the following command to remove the passphrase without prompting for the old passphrase:

```
ssh-keygen -p -P old_passphrase -N "" -f /path/to/your/key
```

Replace "old_passphrase" with your current passphrase, and "/path/to/your/key" with the path to your SSH key.
user
I do not want to use '/home/jack/.ssh/id_ed25519':    I want to use /home/jack/.ssh/blogblocks    how do I change the default
ChatGPT
To use a specific SSH key instead of the default key, you can create a `config` file in your `.ssh` directory and specify the path to the key for each host.

Here is an example of what your `config` file might look like:

```
Host github.com-blogblocks
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/blogblocks
```

In this example, we've created a host alias `github.com-blogblocks` and specified the path to the `blogblocks` SSH key. Now, when you clone a repository from GitHub, you can use the following command:

```
git clone git@github.com-blogblocks:username/repo.git
```

This will use the `blogblocks` key instead of the default key.

Note that you can replace `github.com-blogblocks` with any other name you like for the host alias. Just make sure to use the same name in the `git clone` command.
user
https://github.com/JenniferNorthrup/dad-lambda     I want to clone this using blocblocks account  blogblocks has access my other account does not
ChatGPT
You can clone the repository using the following command, assuming that you have already set up the SSH key for the `blogblocks` account:

```
git clone git@github.com:JenniferNorthrup/dad-lambda.git
```

When you use this command, Git will automatically use the SSH key associated with the `blogblocks` account, as long as it is properly configured in your SSH configuration file (`~/.ssh/config`). If you have multiple SSH keys configured, you can specify which one to use by adding the following lines to your SSH config file:

```
Host github.com
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/blogblocks
```

My current ~/.ssh/config

ChatGPT
Your current `~/.ssh/config` file is setting up a host alias `github.com-blogblocks` to point to `github.com` and use the `~/.ssh/blogblocks` private key for authentication when connecting to the `git` user.

To clone the `dad-lambda` repository using the `blogblocks` account, you can run the following command:

```
git clone git@github.com-blogblocks:JenniferNorthrup/dad-lambda.git
```

This should use the `blogblocks` SSH key for authentication when connecting to the `github.com` server.

Create an AWS Lambda with a trigger of API Gateway at the route /dev/dad-lambda.
ChatGPT
To create an AWS Lambda with a trigger of API Gateway at the route /dev/dad-lambda, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS Lambda service.

2. Click on the "Create function" button.

3. Choose "Author from scratch".

4. In the "Create function" page, enter the following details:
   - Function name: dad-lambda
   - Runtime: Node.js 14.x
   - Permissions: Choose "Create a new role with basic Lambda permissions"
   - Click "Create function"

5. In the function code editor, replace the default code with your own code that will handle the preferences data and store it. For example:

```
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const docClient = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient({region: 'us-east-1'});

exports.handler = async (event) => {
    const preferences = JSON.parse(event.body);
    const { userId, superUser, colorTheme } = preferences;

    const params = {
        TableName: 'UserPreferences',
        Item: {
            userId: userId,
            superUser: superUser,
            colorTheme: colorTheme
        }
    };

    try {
        await docClient.put(params).promise();
        return {
            statusCode: 200,
            body: JSON.stringify({ success: true })
        };
    } catch (err) {
        console.log(err);
        return {
            statusCode: 500,
            body: JSON.stringify({ error: 'Unable to store preferences' })
        };
    }
};
```

6. Save the function code.

7. Next, create an API Gateway trigger for the function:
   - In the "Designer" section of the Lambda function page, click on "Add trigger".
   - Choose "API Gateway" from the list of triggers.
   - Choose "Create a new API" and give it a name like "dad-lambda-api".
   - In the "Security" section, choose "Open" as the security option (you can modify this later for your needs).
   - Click "Add" to create the trigger.

8. Once the API Gateway trigger is created, you can test the Lambda function by clicking on the "Test" button at the top of the function code editor.

This message indicates that there is a network connection open that is preventing Jest from exiting. In this case, it seems that the connection to the MySQL database is still open.

You can fix this by closing the connection in your test code. One way to do this is to add a `beforeAll` and `afterAll` block to your test file that establishes and closes the database connection respectively.

For example:

```
const mysql = require('mysql');
const pool  = mysql.createPool({
  connectionLimit : 10,
  host            : 'localhost',
  user            : 'root',
  password        : 'password',
  database        : 'user_preferences'
});

describe('test', () => {
  beforeAll((done) => {
    pool.getConnection((err, connection) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error('Error connecting to database:', err);
        process.exit(1);
      }
      console.log('Connected to database!');
      connection.release();
      done();
    });
  });

  afterAll(() => {
    pool.end((err) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error('Error closing database connection:', err);
        process.exit(1);
      }
      console.log('Database connection closed!');
    });
  });

  it('should pass', () => {
    expect(true).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

This example uses Jest's `beforeAll` and `afterAll` blocks to establish and close the database connection respectively. In the `beforeAll` block, it connects to the database and then releases the connection. In the `afterAll` block, it ends the pool and logs a message to indicate that the connection has been closed.

You can modify this code to include your own tests and replace the `it('should pass', () => {})` block with your own test cases.

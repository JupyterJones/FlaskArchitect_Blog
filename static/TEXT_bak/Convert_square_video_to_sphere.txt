Convert square video to sphere
user
how do i change a video into a sphere. i don't want to just crop a circle i want to squeeze a square video into a sphere " like a planet". Which is best Python or JavaScript.

To transform a square video into a sphere, Python is a suitable choice due to the powerful libraries available for video manipulation and image processing, such as OpenCV, NumPy, and MoviePy.

Here's a complete Python script to achieve this using OpenCV and NumPy. The idea is to map each point in the output spherical image back to the corresponding point in the original video frame. This will create the effect of squeezing the square video into a spherical shape.

First, ensure you have the required libraries installed:
```sh
pip install opencv-python moviepy numpy
```

Here's the full script:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import moviepy.editor as mp
import logging

# Setup logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

def convert_to_sphere(frame):
    logging.info("Starting frame conversion to sphere.")
    h, w, _ = frame.shape
    radius = min(h, w) // 2

    logging.debug(f"Frame shape: {frame.shape}, Radius: {radius}")

    # Create an empty image for the spherical projection
    sphere_img = np.zeros_like(frame)

    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            x = j - w / 2
            y = i - h / 2
            theta = np.arctan2(y, x)
            r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
            
            if r <= radius:
                r_sphere = radius * np.sin(r / radius * np.pi / 2)
                x_sphere = r_sphere * np.cos(theta)
                y_sphere = r_sphere * np.sin(theta)

                x_source = int(x_sphere + w / 2)
                y_source = int(y_sphere + h / 2)
                
                sphere_img[i, j] = frame[y_source, x_source]

    logging.info("Completed frame conversion to sphere.")
    return sphere_img

def process_video(input_path, output_path):
    logging.info(f"Processing video: {input_path}")
    
    # Load video
    clip = mp.VideoFileClip(input_path)
    fps = clip.fps
    logging.debug(f"Video FPS: {fps}")

    def make_frame(t):
        frame = clip.get_frame(t)
        frame = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_RGB2BGR)
        sphere_frame = convert_to_sphere(frame)
        return cv2.cvtColor(sphere_frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)

    # Create new video clip
    new_clip = mp.VideoClip(make_frame, duration=clip.duration)
    new_clip.set_fps(fps)
    new_clip.write_videofile(output_path, codec='libx264')
    logging.info(f"Output video saved to: {output_path}")

# Example usage
input_video = "input_video.mp4"
output_video = "output_sphere_video.mp4"
process_video(input_video, output_video)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Logging**: Logging is set up at the beginning to track the progress and debug information.
2. **convert_to_sphere Function**: This function converts each frame of the video to a spherical projection. It maps the points from a square to a sphere by calculating the spherical coordinates.
3. **process_video Function**: This function processes the video frame by frame, converts each frame to a spherical projection using the `convert_to_sphere` function, and then saves the new video.

### How to Run the Script:
1. Replace `input_video.mp4` with the path to your input video.
2. Replace `output_sphere_video.mp4` with the desired output video path.
3. Run the script.

This script will take the input video, convert each frame to a spherical projection, and save the output video. Adjustments may be needed based on the specific input video dimensions and desired output quality.

No 'fps' (frames per second) attribute specified for function write_videofile and the clip has no 'fps' attribute. Either provide e.g. fps=24 in the arguments of the function, or define the clip's fps with `clip.fps=24`

Thank you for pointing that out. It seems we need to explicitly set the `fps` attribute for the new clip. Here's the corrected version of the script:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import moviepy.editor as mp
import logging

# Setup logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

def convert_to_sphere(frame):
    logging.info("Starting frame conversion to sphere.")
    h, w, _ = frame.shape
    radius = min(h, w) // 2

    logging.debug(f"Frame shape: {frame.shape}, Radius: {radius}")

    # Create an empty image for the spherical projection
    sphere_img = np.zeros_like(frame)

    for i in range(h):
        for j in range(w):
            x = j - w / 2
            y = i - h / 2
            theta = np.arctan2(y, x)
            r = np.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)
            
            if r <= radius:
                r_sphere = radius * np.sin(r / radius * np.pi / 2)
                x_sphere = r_sphere * np.cos(theta)
                y_sphere = r_sphere * np.sin(theta)

                x_source = int(x_sphere + w / 2)
                y_source = int(y_sphere + h / 2)
                
                sphere_img[i, j] = frame[y_source, x_source]

    logging.info("Completed frame conversion to sphere.")
    return sphere_img

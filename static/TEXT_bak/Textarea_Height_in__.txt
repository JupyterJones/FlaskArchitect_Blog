Textarea Height in %
user
can i express a texarea column in % 
ChatGPT
Certainly, Jack! If you want to express the height of a textarea column in percentage relative to its container, you can use the CSS `height` property with a percentage value. Here's an example of how you can achieve this in a Flask application using HTML and a bit of CSS:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Now, create a folder named `templates` in your project directory, and inside that folder, create a file named `index.html`. Here's the content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Textarea in Percentage</title>
    <style>
        body {
            display: flex;
            align-items: center;
            justify-content: center;
            height: 100vh;
            margin: 0;
        }

        .container {
            width: 50%;
        }

        textarea {
            width: 100%;
            height: 30%; /* You can adjust this percentage as needed */
            resize: none;
        }

        button {
            margin-top: 10px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <textarea id="myTextarea"></textarea>
        <button onclick="getText()">Get Text</button>
    </div>

    <script>
        function getText() {
            var text = document.getElementById("myTextarea").value;
            alert("Textarea Content: " + text);
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, the `height` property of the textarea is set to 30%, but you can adjust this value based on your preference. The container is set to 50% of the width for demonstration purposes.

Feel free to integrate this into your Flask application. Let me know if you need further clarification or modifications, Jack!

I apologize for the confusion. It seems like there might be an issue with the CSS styling. Let's try a different approach. Ensure that the HTML and CSS are properly structured. Here's an updated version for you:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Textarea in Percentage</title>
    <style>
        body {
            display: flex;
            align-items: center;
            justify-content: center;
            height: 100vh;
            margin: 0;
        }

        .container {
            width: 50%;
        }

        #file-content {
            width: 100%;
            height: 30%; /* You can adjust this percentage as needed */
            resize: none;
        }

        button {
            margin-top: 10px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="container">
        <textarea id="file-content"></textarea><br>
        <button onclick="getText()">Get Text</button>
    </div>

    <script>
        function getText() {
            var text = document.getElementById("file-content").value;
            alert("Textarea Content: " + text);
        }
    </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Make sure to replace the existing HTML and CSS with this code. If it still doesn't work, there might be external factors affecting it. In that case, you may want to check for any browser console errors or conflicts with other styles in your project.

Let me know if this resolves the issue, Jack!

but my textarea  is small
ChatGPT
I see, Jack. It seems like the size of your textarea is smaller than you desire. Let's adjust the CSS to make it larger. You can increase the `height` property value for the `#file-content` textarea. Additionally, you may want to set a fixed height or use different units for more precise control. 

Here's an example where I've increased the `height` to 70%, but you can adjust it to your liking:

```html
<!-- templates/edit_file.html -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <!-- ... (existing head content) ... -->
    <style>
        /* ... (existing styles) ... */

        #file-content {
            width: 100%;
            height: 70%; /* Adjust this percentage as needed */
            resize: none;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <!-- ... (existing body content) ... -->
</body>

</html>
```

Feel free to adjust the `height` value until you achieve the desired size for your textarea. If you have a specific size in pixels or another unit in mind, you can use that as well.

Let me know if this resolves the issue or if you have any other specific preferences for the textarea size, Jack!
user
#file-content {
            cols: 100%;
            rows: 30%; 
            resize: true;
        }
what about this ?
ChatGPT
It seems like there might be a misunderstanding with the syntax. The `cols` and `rows` properties are not used in the CSS `textarea` styling. Instead, you should directly use the `width` and `height` properties. Additionally, the correct value for `resize` property is `none` to disable resizing.

Here's the corrected version:

```css
#file-content {
    width: 100%;
    height: 30%; /* Adjust this percentage as needed */
    resize: none;
}
```

Make sure to use `width` and `height` for defining the size of the textarea, and `resize: none;` to prevent users from resizing it.

If you have any further questions or if there's anything else you'd like to adjust, feel free to let me know, Jack!
user
#file-content {
    width: 100%;
    height: 30%; /* Adjust this percentage as needed */
    resize: none;
}
does not work
<textarea id="file-content" ></textarea><br>
ChatGPT
I apologize for the confusion, Jack. It seems like there might be an issue specific to your project or environment. To troubleshoot, let's try a different approach to set the height.

Instead of using a percentage for the height, you can try using a fixed height in pixels. For example:

```css
#file-content {
    width: 100%;
    height: 200px; /* Adjust this value as needed */
    resize: none;
}
```

Replace the `height` property with a fixed pixel value and see if it works as expected. If it does, it might be related to how percentage heights are calculated in your specific layout.

If this still doesn't work, there might be other styles or scripts affecting the layout. You can inspect the element using your browser's developer tools to see if there are any conflicting styles or errors in the console.

Feel free to let me know how it goes, and we can continue troubleshooting if needed.

i want a responsive texarea  not fixed
ChatGPT
Certainly, Jack. If you want a responsive textarea that adjusts its size based on the available space, you can use a combination of percentage heights for both the body and textarea. Additionally, consider using the `vh` (viewport height) unit for a more responsive design.

Here's an example:

```html
<!-- templates/edit_file.html -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <!-- ... (existing head content) ... -->
    <style>
        /* ... (existing styles) ... */

        html,
        body {
            margin: 0;
            padding: 1%;
            height: 100%;
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
            background-image: url('../static/assets/01-back.jpg');
            background-repeat: repeat-y;
            background-size: cover;
            background-position: top;
        }

        .wrapper {
            display: flex;
            flex-direction: column;
            align-items: center;
            justify-content: center;
            min-height: 90vh; /* Adjust this value as needed */
        }

        #file-content {
            width: 100%;
            height: 50%; /* Adjust this percentage as needed */
            resize: none;
        }
    </style>
</head>

<body>
    <!-- ... (existing body content) ... -->
</body>

</html>
```

In this example, I've set the `min-height` of the `.wrapper` to `90vh` to leave some space for other elements and ensure the textarea takes up a reasonable portion of the viewport height.

Feel free to adjust the `height` property of the `#file-content` textarea to meet your preferences. If you still encounter issues, consider inspecting the element using browser developer tools to identify any conflicting styles or issues.

Let me know how this works for you, Jack!

<img size
ChatGPT
It seems like your message is a bit unclear. If you're referring to adjusting the size of an image, you can use the `width` and `height` attributes in the HTML `img` tag.

Here's an example:

```html
<!-- Assuming you want to display an image with a specific size -->
<img src="path/to/your/image.jpg" alt="Your Image" width="300" height="200">
```

In this example, the `width` attribute is set to 300 pixels, and the `height` attribute is set to 200 pixels. You can adjust these values to suit your specific requirements.

If your question is about something else or you need more assistance, please provide additional details or clarification.

<img class="overlaylogo" src={{logo}} width="300" height="200" alt="logo" />
it won't show the logo
ChatGPT
It appears there is a typo in your code when using `random.cchoice`. The correct method name is `random.choice` for selecting a random item from a list.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template, request
import os
import random

app = Flask(__name__)

def logit(message):
    # Your logging function goes here
    print(message)

@app.route('/indexapp', methods=['GET', 'POST'])
def indexapp():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        search_term = request.form.get('search_term')
        logit(f'Searching for files containing: {search_term}')

        # Search for text files in the current directory
        Text_Directory = "static/output_txt_html_json"
        txt_files = [os.path.join(Text_Directory, f) for f in os.listdir(Text_Directory) if f.endswith('.txt')]

        # Filter files containing the search term
        matching_files = [file for file in txt_files if search_term in open(file, 'r').read()]

        logit(f'Found matching files: {matching_files}')
        logo = random.choice(['static/assete/logo1.jpg', 'static/assete/logo2.jpg'])  # Adjust the list of logo paths
        return render_template('indexapp.html', files=matching_files, logo=logo)

    logo = random.choice(['static/assete/logo1.jpg', 'static/assete/logo2.jpg'])  # Adjust the list of logo paths
    return render_template('indexapp.html', files=None, logo=logo)
```

Make sure to adjust the list of logo paths inside the `random.choice` function to match the actual paths in your project. With this correction, the selected logo should display correctly in your HTML template.

ChatGPT
To save the video with a date-stamped filename, you can modify your script to include the date in the output filename. Here's an example of how you can achieve this using the `date` command in a Bash script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get the current date and time in the format YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
current_date=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")

# Build the output filename with the current date
output_filename="Local_video_${current_date}.mp4"

# Your original ffmpeg command with the updated output filename
ffmpeg -ss 5 -f pulse -i alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo.monitor -f x11grab -framerate 30 -video_size 1366x760 -i :0.0 -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a aac -strict -2 -g 120 "$output_filename"
```

In this script:

- `${current_date}` is a variable holding the current date and time in the format `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`.
- The `output_filename` variable is constructed using this date, and the filename is appended with `_Local_video.mp4`.

Now, each time you run the script, it will create a video file with a name like `Local_video_20220124_145630.mp4`, indicating the date and time of the recording.

Feel free to customize the date format or filename as per your preferences.

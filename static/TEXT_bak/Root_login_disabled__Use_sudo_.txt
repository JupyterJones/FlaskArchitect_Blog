Root login disabled. Use sudo.
user
vps|~ $ login root
login: Cannot possibly work without effective root
ChatGPT
It seems like you're trying to log in as the root user, but the system is not allowing it. Typically, logging in directly as the root user is disabled for security reasons. Instead, you should log in as a regular user and then use the `su` or `sudo` commands to perform administrative tasks.

If you're trying to execute a command as the root user, you can use `sudo` followed by the command you want to run. For example:

```
sudo command_to_run
```

You'll be prompted to enter your password, and if you have the necessary permissions, the command will be executed with root privileges.

If you still need to enable direct root login, you may need to modify your system's configuration, but it's generally not recommended due to security concerns.

how do i remove the offending repository from my VPS
ChatGPT
To remove the MongoDB repository from your VPS, you'll need to edit the list of repositories stored in the `/etc/apt/sources.list` file or in a file within the `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/` directory. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Identify the repository file**:
   First, you need to determine which file contains the MongoDB repository. You can list the files in the `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/` directory to find it:
   ```bash
   ls /etc/apt/sources.list.d/
   ```

   Look for any file related to MongoDB, such as `mongodb-org.list`.

2. **Edit the repository file**:
   Once you've identified the file, you can edit it using a text editor. For example, if the file is named `mongodb-org.list`, you can edit it with `nano`:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org.list
   ```

   Remove the line that starts with `deb` and contains the MongoDB repository URL. It should look something like this:
   ```
   deb https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu bionic/mongodb-org/4.0 multiverse
   ```

   Delete this line and save the changes.

3. **Update the package lists**:
   After removing the repository, you should update the package lists to ensure that the changes take effect:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   ```

   This will refresh the list of available packages, excluding the MongoDB repository.

After following these steps, the MongoDB repository should be removed from your VPS, and you should no longer encounter the GPG error related to it. If you have any further questions or issues, feel free to ask!

sudo wget -qO - https://as-repository.openvpn.net/as-repo-publ
E: This command can only be used by root.
ChatGPT
It seems like you're trying to execute a command with `sudo` to download a file using `wget`, but you encountered an error stating that the command can only be used by root.

This error occurs because `wget` is attempting to read input from standard input (stdin) to download the file, but `sudo` is not allowing it. To resolve this, you can simply run `wget` without `sudo`:

```bash
wget -qO - https://as-repository.openvpn.net/as-repo-public.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
```

This command will download the GPG key for the OpenVPN repository and add it to the list of trusted keys using `sudo`. Make sure to replace `as-repo-public.gpg` with the correct filename if necessary.

If you encounter any further issues or have any questions, feel free to ask!

sudo ./openvpn-install.sh
The system does not have the TUN device available.
TUN needs to be enabled before running this installer.
how do i start tun
ChatGPT
To enable the TUN device on your system, you can typically do so by loading the TUN kernel module. Here's how you can start the TUN device:

1. **Check if TUN is already loaded**:
   Run the following command to see if the TUN module is already loaded:
   ```bash
   lsmod | grep tun
   ```

   If you see output indicating that the TUN module is already loaded, you can skip the next step.

2. **Load the TUN module**:
   If the TUN module is not already loaded, you can load it using the `modprobe` command:
   ```bash
   sudo modprobe tun
   ```

   This command will load the TUN module, making the TUN device available for use.

3. **Verify TUN availability**:
   You can verify that the TUN device is now available by running the `lsmod` command again and checking for the presence of the TUN module:
   ```bash
   lsmod | grep tun
   ```

   If the TUN module is listed, then the TUN device should now be available for use.

After enabling the TUN device, you can try running your OpenVPN installer again:

```bash
sudo ./openvpn-install.sh
```

It should now proceed without reporting the "TUN device not available" error. If you encounter any further issues or have any questions, feel free to ask!

ChatGPT
It seems that the TUN module is already loaded on your system, which is a good sign. However, the error message you encountered suggests that the TUN device might not be properly configured or available for use.

Here are a few troubleshooting steps you can try:

1. **Check TUN device permissions**:
   Ensure that the permissions for the TUN device are set correctly. The TUN device should typically be accessible by the root user and the `openvpn` group. You can check the permissions using the following command:
   ```bash
   ls -l /dev
et/tun
   ```

   If the permissions are incorrect, you can adjust them using the `chmod` command:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod 0666 /dev
et/tun
   ```

2. **Restart OpenVPN service**:
   Sometimes, restarting the OpenVPN service can resolve issues with the TUN device. You can restart the service using:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart openvpn
   ```

3. **Check for conflicts**:
   Ensure that there are no conflicts with other VPN software or firewalls that might be preventing the TUN device from being accessed.

After trying these steps, attempt to run the OpenVPN installer again:

```bash
sudo ./openvpn-install.sh
```

If the issue persists, you may need to investigate further or seek assistance from the OpenVPN community or support channels. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

 ls -l /dev
et/tun
ls: cannot access '/dev
et/tun': No such file or directory
ChatGPT
It appears that the `/dev
et/tun` device node does not exist on your system, which indicates that the TUN/TAP driver is not properly configured or loaded.

To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the TUN/TAP driver is installed and properly configured on your system. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Install the TUN/TAP driver**:
   Depending on your Linux distribution, you may need to install the TUN/TAP driver package. For example, on Ubuntu/Debian-based systems, you can install it using:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y openvpn-systemd-resolved
   ```

2. **Load the TUN/TAP module**:
   After installing the TUN/TAP driver package, you should load the TUN module manually. You can do this using the `modprobe` command:
   ```bash
   sudo modprobe tun
   ```

3. **Check for TUN/TAP device**:
   After loading the TUN module, verify that the `/dev
et/tun` device node has been created:
   ```bash
   ls -l /dev
et/tun
   ```

   If the device node exists, you should see output similar to:
   ```
   crw------- 1 root root 10, 200 Mar  4 10:25 /dev
et/tun
   ```

4. **Persistently load TUN module** (optional):
   To ensure that the TUN module is loaded automatically at boot time, you can add it to the `/etc/modules` file. Open the file with a text editor and add the following line:
   ```
   tun
   ```

   Save the file and reboot your system to apply the changes.

Once you've completed these steps, try running your OpenVPN installer again:

```bash
sudo ./openvpn-install.sh
```

If the TUN/TAP driver is properly configured and loaded, the installer should proceed without reporting any errors related to the TUN device. If you encounter any further issues, feel free to ask for assistance!

add vcn to my ubuntu 18.04 server
ChatGPT
To add a Virtual Network Computing (VNC) server to your Ubuntu 18.04 server, you can use a software package called `tightvncserver`. Here's how you can install and set up VNC on your server:

1. **Install TightVNC Server**:
   First, update your package index and install `tightvncserver`:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install tightvncserver
   ```

2. **Run TightVNC Server**:
   Next, start the TightVNC server by running the following command:
   ```bash
   tightvncserver
   ```
   This command will prompt you to set a password for VNC access. Enter a password when prompted and confirm it.

3. **Start the VNC Server Session**:
   After setting the password, you can start a VNC session with the command:
   ```bash
   tightvncserver :1
   ```
   This command will start a VNC server on display port `:1`.

4. **Access the VNC Server**:
   You can now use a VNC client like RealVNC, TightVNC, or VNC Viewer to connect to your server using its IP address and the port specified (e.g., `your_server_ip:1`). When prompted, enter the password you set earlier.

5. **Optional: Configure VNC Server**:
   You can customize your VNC server configuration by editing the `~/.vnc/xstartup` file. This file controls what graphical environment is started when you connect to the VNC server. By default, it starts a simple desktop environment. You can modify it to start a specific window manager or desktop environment.

6. **Enable VNC Server at Boot (Optional)**:
   If you want the VNC server to start automatically when your server boots up, you can create a systemd service file for it. Here's a simple example of how to create and enable such a service:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/vncserver@.service
   ```
   Add the following content to the file:
   ```
   [Unit]
   Description=VNC Server for %i
   After=syslog.target network.target

   [Service]
   Type=forking
   User=your_username
   Group=your_username
   WorkingDirectory=/home/your_username
   ExecStartPre=-/usr/bin/vncserver -kill :%i > /dev
ull 2>&1
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/vncserver -geometry 1280x1024 -depth 24 :%i
   ExecStop=/usr/bin/vncserver -kill :%i

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```
   Replace `your_username` with your actual username. Save the file and exit the text editor.

   Then, enable the service to start at boot and start it:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable vncserver@1.service
   sudo systemctl start vncserver@1.service
   ```

That's it! You now have a VNC server set up on your Ubuntu 18.04 server. You can connect to it using a VNC client and access the server's graphical environment.

It seems like you've provided the output of the systemd-resolved configuration showing DNSSEC Negative Trust Anchors (NTAs) for reverse DNS zones and some internal DNS domains.

DNSSEC Negative Trust Anchors (NTAs) are used to disable DNSSEC validation for specific zones to address issues with misconfigured or non-compliant DNS servers. These zones listed in your output are reverse DNS zones and some internal DNS domains.

If you're experiencing DNS resolution issues with these zones, you may consider removing them from the DNSSEC NTA list. However, please note that removing DNSSEC NTAs should be done cautiously and only if necessary, as it may expose your system to DNS security vulnerabilities.

To remove DNSSEC NTAs, you can edit the systemd-resolved configuration file `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf` and remove the lines specifying the NTAs. For example, if you want to remove the NTA for the `corp` domain, you would remove the line `corp` from the configuration file.

Here's how you can edit the configuration file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/resolved.conf
```

Remove the lines specifying the DNSSEC NTAs that you want to remove, save the file, and then restart the systemd-resolved service to apply the changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
```

After removing the DNSSEC NTAs and restarting systemd-resolved, test DNS resolution to see if the issue has been resolved. If you continue to encounter issues or have further questions, feel free to ask!

ping google.com
ping: google.com: Name or service not known

ChatGPT
It seems like the issue with DNS resolution persists even after removing the DNSSEC NTAs. Let's try a few more troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check systemd-resolved status**: 
   Verify the status of the systemd-resolved service and ensure that it's running properly:
   ```bash
   systemctl status systemd-resolved
   ```
   Look for any error messages or warnings in the output that might indicate issues with the service.

2. **Restart systemd-resolved**: 
   If the service is not running or if there are any errors, restart the systemd-resolved service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart systemd-resolved
   ```

3. **Verify resolv.conf**: 
   Check the contents of the `/etc/resolv.conf` file to ensure it's pointing to the systemd-resolved stub resolver:
   ```bash
   cat /etc/resolv.conf
   ```
   It should contain a line like `nameserver 127.0.0.53`.

4. **Check DNS configuration**: 
   Ensure that your DNS servers are configured correctly in systemd-resolved. You can check the configuration by examining the `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf` file.

5. **Temporary DNS server**: 
   As a temporary workaround, you can try adding a public DNS server (e.g., Google DNS) directly to `/etc/resolv.conf` to see if DNS resolution works:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
   ```
   Add the following lines:
   ```
   nameserver 8.8.8.8
   nameserver 8.8.4.4
   ```
   Save the file and try pinging a domain name again.

6. **Network Manager DNS settings**: 
   If you're using Network Manager, ensure that its DNS settings are not conflicting with systemd-resolved. You can check and modify the DNS settings using the Network Manager GUI or command-line tools.

After performing these steps, try pinging a domain name again to see if the DNS resolution issue has been resolved. If you continue to encounter issues, please provide any error messages or output you receive, and I'll assist you further.

The `systemd-resolved` service appears to be running properly, as indicated by the "Active: active (running)" status in the output of `systemctl status systemd-resolved`.

Since `systemd-resolved` is running and there are no obvious issues with its status, the problem with DNS resolution may lie elsewhere.

Let's try adding a public DNS server directly to `/etc/resolv.conf` as a temporary workaround and see if it resolves the DNS resolution issue:

1. Open the `/etc/resolv.conf` file for editing:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/resolv.conf
   ```

2. Add the following lines to the file to use Google DNS servers:
   ```
   nameserver 8.8.8.8
   nameserver 8.8.4.4
   ```

3. Save the file and exit the text editor.

4. Try pinging a domain name again to see if the DNS resolution issue has been resolved:
   ```bash
   ping google.com
   ```

If DNS resolution works after adding the public DNS servers to `/etc/resolv.conf`, it suggests that there may be a problem with the configuration of `systemd-resolved` or its interaction with other components of your system.

Please let me know the outcome of this test, and if you continue to experience issues, I'll assist you further.

list ip
ChatGPT
To list the IP addresses assigned to your network interfaces, you can use the `ip addr` command. Here's how:

```bash
ip addr
```

This command will display detailed information about all network interfaces on your system, including their IP addresses, subnet masks, and other relevant details.

If you're specifically interested in only the IP addresses assigned to your interfaces, you can use the following command to filter the output:

```bash
ip addr show | grep inet
```

This will show only the lines containing IPv4 addresses assigned to your interfaces.

If you're interested in seeing only the IP addresses without any additional information, you can use `awk` to extract just the IP addresses:

```bash
ip addr show | awk '/inet / {print $2}'
```

This command will print out only the IPv4 addresses assigned to your interfaces.

how do i view vcn from local computer 
ChatGPT
To view a Virtual Network Computing (VNC) session from your local computer, you'll need a VNC client software installed on your local machine. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Install a VNC Client**:
   First, you'll need to install a VNC client software on your local computer. There are several VNC client options available for different operating systems. Some popular choices include RealVNC, TightVNC, TigerVNC, and VNC Viewer. Choose one that is compatible with your operating system and install it.

2. **Determine VNC Server IP and Port**:
   You'll need to know the IP address of the server where the VNC server is running and the port number of the VNC session you want to view. The default VNC port is 5900, but if multiple VNC sessions are running on the server, they'll typically use different port numbers (e.g., 5901, 5902, etc.).

3. **Launch VNC Client**:
   Open your VNC client software on your local computer. You'll typically find it in your list of installed applications or in the Start menu on Windows.

4. **Connect to VNC Server**:
   In the VNC client software, enter the IP address of the VNC server followed by a colon (:) and the port number of the VNC session you want to connect to. For example, if the server's IP address is `192.168.1.100` and the VNC session is running on port `5901`, you would enter `192.168.1.100:5901`.

5. **Enter VNC Server Password**:
   If password authentication is enabled for the VNC server, you'll be prompted to enter the password for the VNC session. Enter the password and click "Connect" or "OK" to establish the connection.

6. **View VNC Session**:
   Once the connection is established, you should be able to view the remote desktop or screen of the VNC server on your local computer through the VNC client software.

That's it! You should now be able to view and interact with the VNC session from your local computer using the VNC client software. If you encounter any issues or have further questions, feel free to ask!

is there a way to verify wwith terminal ? curl or something?
ChatGPT
Yes, you can verify the availability of the VNC server using terminal commands like `ping` or `telnet`. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Ping Command**:
   You can use the `ping` command to check if the remote VNC server is reachable over the network. Open your terminal and run the following command, replacing `IP_ADDRESS` with the actual IP address of the VNC server:
   ```bash
   ping IP_ADDRESS
   ```
   If the VNC server is reachable, you should see successful ping responses. If there's no response, it indicates that the server may be unreachable or there could be network connectivity issues.

2. **Telnet Command**:
   You can also use the `telnet` command to check if the VNC port is open and accepting connections. Run the following command, replacing `IP_ADDRESS` and `PORT_NUMBER` with the actual IP address and port number of the VNC server:
   ```bash
   telnet IP_ADDRESS PORT_NUMBER
   ```
   If the VNC port is open and accepting connections, you'll see a blank screen or a message indicating a successful connection. If the connection fails or times out, it indicates that the port may be closed or there could be firewall restrictions preventing access.

Using these terminal commands, you can verify the availability of the VNC server and troubleshoot any connectivity issues from your local machine. If you encounter any problems, you can further investigate based on the results of these commands. Let me know if you need further assistance!

sudo ufw allow 5109
ChatGPT
Opening port 5109 with `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall) can be done using the following command:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 5109/tcp
```

This command allows TCP traffic on port 5109. If you need to allow UDP traffic, you can add the `proto udp` option:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 5109/udp
```

After running the command, make sure to check the status of `ufw` to ensure that the rule has been applied correctly:

```bash
sudo ufw status
```

You should see the newly added rule listed in the output. If `ufw` is not enabled, you can enable it with:

```bash
sudo ufw enable
```

Please note that opening ports in the firewall should be done cautiously to ensure the security of your system. Make sure to only open ports that are necessary for your applications and services.

i run this command every day, 
sudo fstrim -av

Running the `sudo fstrim -av` command on your SSD is beneficial for maintaining its performance and longevity. This command informs the SSD which blocks are no longer in use, allowing the drive to internally free up space and improve performance over time. It's not abusive; in fact, it's a recommended practice for SSD maintenance.

In the context of your Linux environment, the command you're using (`sudo fstrim -av`) is appropriate for trimming all mounted filesystems. The `-a` option ensures that all mounted filesystems are trimmed, and the `-v` option provides verbose output, giving you more information about the trimming process.

If you're running this command daily, it might be a bit frequent, as SSDs typically don't need trimming on a daily basis. You could consider running it weekly or monthly, depending on your usage patterns. Running it too frequently won't harm your SSD, but it might be unnecessary unless you're constantly writing and deleting large amounts of data.

i do several thousand file changes, creations and deletions daily

Given your high volume of daily file changes, creations, and deletions, running the `sudo fstrim -av` command daily is reasonable. The frequent file operations can lead to a higher number of deleted blocks, and trimming helps in maintaining optimal performance by informing the SSD about the unused blocks.

Since your workflow involves several thousand file changes, it's a good practice to continue with the daily trimming routine. It ensures that your SSD remains efficient and responsive over time.

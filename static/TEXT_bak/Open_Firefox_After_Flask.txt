why didn't this start firefox

To ensure that Firefox starts properly and opens a new window with the specified URL, you need to make sure a few things are in place:

1. **Importing the required modules**: The script should import the `os` module.
2. **Starting the Flask app**: The Flask app should be started before opening the Firefox window. The `os.system` command to open Firefox should be called after the Flask app has started.

Here's the complete script with detailed logging:

```python
import os
import logging
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Hello, Flask!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Configure logging
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
    
    logging.debug("Starting the Flask application on port 5500")
    port = 5500
    host = '0.0.0.0'

    # Start the Flask application
    app.run(debug=True, host=host, port=port)

    # Open Firefox with the specified URL
    url = f"http://localhost:{port}"
    firefox_command = f"firefox --new-window {url}"

    logging.debug(f"Running command: {firefox_command}")
    os.system(firefox_command)
    logging.debug("Firefox should be open now.")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Importing modules**: The script imports the necessary `os` and `logging` modules.
2. **Flask app**: A simple Flask app with a home route is defined.
3. **Logging configuration**: Logging is configured to show debug messages.
4. **Starting the Flask app**: The Flask app is started with `app.run(debug=True, host=host, port=port)`.
5. **Opening Firefox**: After the Flask app has started, the script constructs the command to open Firefox and logs this action. The `os.system` function is then used to execute the command.

### Note:
Running `os.system` after starting the Flask app will not execute because `app.run` is a blocking call; it keeps running the server and won't proceed to the next lines. To address this, you can use a separate thread or a subprocess to open the browser. Hereâ€™s an improved version that uses threading:

```python
import os
import logging
import threading
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Hello, Flask!"

def open_browser():
    url = "http://localhost:5500"
    firefox_command = f"firefox --new-window {url}"
    logging.debug(f"Running command: {firefox_command}")
    os.system(firefox_command)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Configure logging
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
    
    logging.debug("Starting the Flask application on port 5500")
    port = 5500
    host = '0.0.0.0'

    # Start a thread to open the browser
    threading.Thread(target=open_browser).start()

    # Start the Flask application
    app.run(debug=True, host=host, port=port)
```

In this version, a new thread is started to open the browser, allowing the Flask app to run concurrently. This ensures that Firefox will open with the specified URL while the Flask app is running.

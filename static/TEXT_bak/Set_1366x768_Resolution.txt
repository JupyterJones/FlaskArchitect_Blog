To set the VNC server resolution to 1366x768, you need to modify the command used to start the VNC server. Assuming you're using `vncserver` command with systemd service, you can follow these steps:

1. Edit the systemd service file for VNC server:
   
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/vncserver@.service
   ```

2. Find the line starting with `ExecStart=`. It should look something like this:

   ```plaintext
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/vncserver -geometry 1280x1024 -depth 24 :1
   ```

3. Modify the `-geometry` option to set the resolution to 1366x768:

   ```plaintext
   ExecStart=/usr/bin/vncserver -geometry 1366x768 -depth 24 :1
   ```

4. Save the file and exit the text editor.

5. Reload systemd to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

6. Restart the VNC server for changes to take effect:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart vncserver@1.service
   ```

Now your VNC server should be running with a resolution of 1366x768. You can verify this by connecting to the VNC server and checking the display settings. If you face any issues, check the logs for any errors:

```bash
sudo journalctl -xe
```

This should help you set the desired resolution for your VNC server. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!

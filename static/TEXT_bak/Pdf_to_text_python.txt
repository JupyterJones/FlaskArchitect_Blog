To convert a PDF to text in Python, you can use the `PyMuPDF` library (also known as `fitz`). Below is a complete script that demonstrates how to extract text from a PDF file using `PyMuPDF`, with detailed comments and logging for clarity.

First, you need to install `PyMuPDF` if you haven't already:

```sh
pip install PyMuPDF
```

Here is the complete Python script to convert a PDF to text:

```python
import fitz  # PyMuPDF
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

def pdf_to_text(pdf_path, output_txt_path):
    try:
        logging.info(f"Opening PDF file: {pdf_path}")
        document = fitz.open(pdf_path)
        
        text = ""
        for page_num in range(len(document)):
            logging.info(f"Processing page {page_num + 1} of {len(document)}")
            page = document.load_page(page_num)
            text += page.get_text()

        logging.info(f"Writing extracted text to: {output_txt_path}")
        with open(output_txt_path, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as output_file:
            output_file.write(text)

        logging.info("PDF to text conversion completed successfully.")
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"An error occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pdf_path = "path/to/your/input.pdf"  # Replace with the path to your PDF file
    output_txt_path = "path/to/your/output.txt"  # Replace with the desired output text file path
    pdf_to_text(pdf_path, output_txt_path)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Importing Modules**:
   - `import fitz`: Imports the `PyMuPDF` library.
   - `import logging`: Imports the logging module to handle logging.

2. **Logging Configuration**:
   - Configures the logging to display messages with the time, log level, and message.

3. **Function `pdf_to_text`**:
   - **Parameters**: 
     - `pdf_path`: Path to the input PDF file.
     - `output_txt_path`: Path to the output text file.
   - **Process**:
     - Opens the PDF file.
     - Iterates over each page in the PDF.
     - Extracts text from each page and accumulates it into a single string.
     - Writes the accumulated text to the specified output text file.
   - **Exception Handling**: Logs any errors that occur during the process.

4. **Main Execution Block**:
   - Sets the paths for the input PDF file and the output text file.
   - Calls the `pdf_to_text` function with the specified paths.

### Running the Script:
- Replace `"path/to/your/input.pdf"` with the actual path to your PDF file.
- Replace `"path/to/your/output.txt"` with the desired path for the output text file.
- Run the script to extract text from the PDF and save it to a text file.

This script provides a clear and complete solution for converting a PDF to text in Python, including detailed logging to help trace the process.

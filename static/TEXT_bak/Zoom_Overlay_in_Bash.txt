Zoom Overlay in Bash

Certainly, Jack! To create a one-liner bash command for running `zoom_overlay` on the current directory, you can use the following:

```bash
zoom_overlay "$(pwd)"
```

This command uses `$(pwd)` to get the current directory and passes it as an argument to `zoom_overlay`. The double quotes around `$(pwd)` ensure that the command works correctly even if the directory path contains spaces.

Feel free to let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else you'd like assistance with!

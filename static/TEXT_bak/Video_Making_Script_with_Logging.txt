Video Making Script with Logging

ChatGPT
It seems like there are some issues in your code snippet. Let's correct it and provide a complete script with explanations and logging. Here's an improved version of your code:

```python
import random
import os
import logging

# Define a function to choose a directory
def choose_dir():
    # Modify this function to choose a directory or path as per your requirements
    # For this example, let's choose a random directory
    return random.choice(['/path/to/directory1', '/path/to/directory2'])

# Define a function to make a video
def make_video(directory):
    # Modify this function to create a video using the chosen directory
    # For this example, let's just log the directory and a message
    logging.info(f"Making a video in directory: {directory}")
    # Your video creation code goes here

if __name == "__main__":
    # Configure logging
    logging.basicConfig(filename='video_maker.log', level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s: %(message)s')

    try:
        for i in range(0, 50):
            DIR = choose_dir()
            print(DIR)
            make_video(DIR)
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
        # You may choose to run the loop again or handle the error as needed
```

In this corrected code:

1. We have defined the `choose_dir` and `make_video` functions, but you should replace them with your actual implementation for choosing directories and making videos.

2. We have added logging to capture information about the process, which can help in debugging and tracking what the code is doing.

3. We handle exceptions and log any errors that occur during the execution.

Please replace the placeholder functions (`choose_dir` and `make_video`) with your actual code for directory selection and video creation. This script logs relevant information and errors in a file named `video_maker.log` for your reference.

```

In this corrected code:

1. We've fixed the issue with the `directory` variable not being defined by changing `directory` to `DIR` to match your variable naming.

2. Added a check for the existence of image files in the chosen directory.

3. Fixed the path for the `out_path` and `final_output_path` to use the chosen directory correctly.

4. Adjusted the logging and error handling as you requested.

Please replace the placeholder functions (`choose_dir` and `get_an_mp3`) with your actual code for directory selection and audio file retrieval. This script logs relevant information and errors in a file named `video_maker.log` for your reference.

I understand your requirements. To make the script continue trying to make videos after an error and limit the videos to less than 57 seconds, you can modify your code as follows:

```python

        return

    # Shuffle the image files to mix them randomly
    random.shuffle(image_files)
    print(len(image_files))
    im = Image.open(image_files[0])

        if video_duration >= 57:  # Limit video to 57 seconds
            break

        img1 = resized_images[i]
        img2 = resized_images[(i + 1) % len(resized_images)]  # Wrap around to the first image
        # changing the alpha step size will change the duration of the fade effect
        step_size = 5
        for alpha in range(0, 150):  # Gradually change alpha from 0 to 100 for fade effect
            alpha /= 150.0
            blended = cv2.addWeighted(img1, 1 - alpha, img2, alpha, 0)
            out.write(blended)
            video_duration += 1 / 30  # Assuming 30 FPS

    print("MP4_FILE: ", mp4_file)
    print("Final_Output_Path: ", final_output_path)
    shutil.copyfile(final_output_path, mp4_file)
    print(mp4_file)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Configure logging
    logging.basicConfig(filename='video_maker.log', level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s: %(message)s')

            print(DIR)

                makevideo(DIR)
            except Exception as e:
                logging.error(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
```

In this updated code:

1. The videos are limited to 57 seconds by changing the condition `if video_duration >= 57`.

2. The script continues making videos even after an error by wrapping the `makevideo` call inside a try-except block, and logging any errors that occur.

3. Added an exception handler for KeyboardInterrupt, so you can stop the script with Ctrl+C without logging an error.

This code should meet your requirements for video duration and error handling.

This code calculates the video duration based on the number of images and frames per second and enforces the limit to be less than 58 seconds. It should create videos with a duration of less than 58 seconds as intended.

With this code, videos should be limited to a duration of less than 58 seconds, and they will be shorter if the number of images available results in a shorter video.

Why is it you can not limit the video length to 58 seconds. Some are as long as 2 minutes. 
ChatGPT
I apologize for the oversight. It seems there was a misunderstanding in the previous code. To ensure that the video length is limited to 58 seconds, you can add a simple check to enforce this limit. Here's the modified code:

    out.release()

    # Prepare an audio clip of the same duration (limited to 58 seconds)

This code will enforce that the video duration does not exceed 58 seconds and should work as expected.

Please comment to show me where the length is limited

Certainly, I've added comments to the code to indicate where the video length is limited to a maximum of 58 seconds:

```python
# ...

def makevideo(directory):
    logging.info(f"Making a video in directory: {directory}")
    image_files = random.sample(glob.glob(directory + "/*.jpg"), 27)

    if not image_files:
        print(f"No image files found in {directory}.")
        return

    # Shuffle the image files to mix them randomly
    random.shuffle(image_files)
    print(len(image_files))
    im = Image.open(image_files[0])
    SIZE = im.size

    # Create a temporary directory to store the resized images
    temp_dir = 'temp/'
    os.makedirs(temp_dir, exist_ok=True)

    # Load and resize the images
    resized_images = []
    for image_file in image_files:
        im = Image.open(image_file)
        SIZE = im.size

        img = cv2.imread(image_file)
        imgs = cv2.resize(img, SIZE)  # Resize to the same size as the original image
        resized_images.append(imgs)

    # Calculate the video duration based on the number of frames and frames per second
    video_duration = len(resized_images) / 30  # Assuming 30 FPS

    # Limit the video duration to a maximum of 58 seconds
    if video_duration > 58:
        resized_images = resized_images[:int(58 * 30)]  # Trim frames to 58 seconds

    # Create a video writer
    out_path = 'output.mp4'
    fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'mp4v')  # You may need to change the codec depending on your system
    out = cv2.VideoWriter(out_path, fourcc, 30, SIZE)

    # ...

    # Prepare an audio clip of the same duration (limited to 58 seconds)
    audio_clip = AudioFileClip(get_an_mp3())  # Replace with your audio file path
    audio_clip = audio_clip.subclip(0, min(58, video_duration))

    # ...

    # Set the audio of the video clip
    video_clip = video_clip.set_audio(audio_clip)

    # Ensure video duration is not longer than 58 seconds
    video_clip = video_clip.subclip(0, min(58, video_duration))

    # ...

The code limits the video duration to 58 seconds by trimming the frames to match the desired length if it exceeds 58 seconds.

I apologize for any confusion. It appears I missed adding a comment for the specific line that limits the video length. Here's the comment you can add to indicate where the video length is limited:

```python
    # Limit the video duration to a maximum of 58 seconds
    if video_duration > 58:
        resized_images = resized_images[:int(58 * 30)]  # Trim frames to 58 seconds

I see the issue. It seems that the script isn't executing because the indentation for the last `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is incorrect. To fix this, make sure that the entire block is properly indented. Here's the corrected script:

Please ensure the script's indentation is correct, and it should execute as expected.

is that correct ?

No, the code block you provided has a minor syntax issue. The string formatting in the `logging.error` line is not correctly closed. It should be like this:

```python
logging.error(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")
```

Here's the corrected code block:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Configure logging
    logging.basicConfig(filename='video_maker.log', level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s: %(message)s')

    try:
        for i in range(0, 50):
            DIR = choose_dir()
            print(DIR)
            try:
                makevideo(DIR)
            except Exception as e:
                logging.error(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")  # Corrected the string formatting
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
```

With this correction, your logging of errors will work correctly.

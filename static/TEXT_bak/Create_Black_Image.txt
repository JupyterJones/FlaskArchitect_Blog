It looks like there are a couple of syntax errors in your code. Let's correct them and also include some logging for better understanding. I'll assume you want to create a black image with dimensions 640x640. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import logging
from PIL import Image

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def create_black_image(width, height):
    """
    Create a black image with the specified width and height.

    Parameters:
    - width (int): The width of the image.
    - height (int): The height of the image.

    Returns:
    - Image: The black image.
    """
    try:
        # Creating a new black image
        imnew = Image.new("RGB", (width, height), (0, 0, 0))

        logging.info("Successfully created a black image.")
        return imnew

    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error creating a black image: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
image_width = 640
image_height = 640

resulting_image = create_black_image(image_width, image_height)

# Check if the image creation was successful
if resulting_image:
    # You can continue working with the 'resulting_image' here
    pass
else:
    logging.error("Image creation failed. Check the logs for details.")
```

This script defines a function `create_black_image` that takes the width and height as parameters and returns a black image. The script also includes logging statements to provide information about the process and any potential errors. Feel free to adjust the width and height as needed for your project. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else you'd like to add.

import os
os(get.cwd)

It seems there's a small mistake in your code. The correct function to get the current working directory is `os.getcwd()`. Here's the corrected code with logging included:

```python
import os
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def get_current_working_directory():
    """
    Get the current working directory.

    Returns:
    - str: The current working directory.
    """
    try:
        # Getting the current working directory
        cwd = os.getcwd()

        logging.info(f"Current working directory: {cwd}")
        return cwd

    except Exception as e:
        logging.error(f"Error getting the current working directory: {e}")
        return None

# Example usage
current_directory = get_current_working_directory()

# Check if getting the current working directory was successful
if current_directory:
    # You can continue working with the 'current_directory' here
    pass
else:
    logging.error("Failed to get the current working directory. Check the logs for details.")
```

This script defines a function `get_current_working_directory` that retrieves and logs the current working directory. Adjust the script as needed for your use case. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else you'd like assistance with.

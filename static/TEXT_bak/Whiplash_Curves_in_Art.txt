is there an ffmpeg that will play a movie bacwards ?
ChatGPT
Yes, you can use FFmpeg to play a movie backward by reversing the frames. The following command can be used to achieve this:

```bash
ffmpeg -i input.mp4 -vf reverse reversed_output.mp4
```

This command takes an input video file (`input.mp4`) and applies the `reverse` filter to it, creating a new output file (`reversed_output.mp4`). The `-vf reverse` option instructs FFmpeg to reverse the frames of the video.

Feel free to replace `input.mp4` with the actual filename of your video. After running this command, you'll have a new video file (`reversed_output.mp4`) that plays the original video in reverse.

Keep in mind that the quality of the reversed video may be affected, especially if the original video has any effects or edits. Additionally, audio in the reversed video will also be reversed. If you want to reverse the video without affecting the audio, you may need to extract the audio, reverse the video frames, and then recombine them.

In many Linux applications, including text editors and other software, the keyboard shortcut for redoing an action is generally **Ctrl + Shift + Z**. This is a common convention, but it's always a good idea to check the specific application's documentation or menu options, as some applications might have variations in keyboard shortcuts. 

If **Ctrl + Shift + Z** doesn't work in a particular Linux application, you can often find the redo option in the "Edit" menu of the application, and the associated keyboard shortcut will be listed next to the "Redo" option.

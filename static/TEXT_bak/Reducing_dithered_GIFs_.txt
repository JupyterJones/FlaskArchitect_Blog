the resulting gif is very dithered how do I remove the dither look ?

To reduce the dithered look of the resulting GIF, you can try the following techniques:

1. Increase the number of clusters (colors) used in K-means clustering. This can help to better capture the range of colors in the original image and reduce the number of dithered areas.

2. Use a different interpolation method in the `cv2.remap()` function. The default interpolation method, `cv2.INTER_CUBIC`, can sometimes result in a dithered look. You can try using `cv2.INTER_LINEAR` or `cv2.INTER_NEAREST` instead.

3. Use a different image format for saving the GIF. The GIF format only supports a limited number of colors, which can result in a dithered look. You can try saving the animation as a video format such as MP4 or WebM, which can support a higher number of colors and result in a smoother animation.

4. Apply some post-processing filters to the resulting GIF, such as a blur or a noise reduction filter. This can help to smooth out any remaining dithered areas and give the animation a more polished look.

Could you make example code  save as animated.mp4
ChatGPT
Sure, here is an example code that saves the animation as an MP4 video file using OpenCV:

```python
import numpy as np
import cv2

# Read the image
img = cv2.imread("/home/jack/Desktop/HDD500/collections
ewdownloads/512x512/2023-04-13-11-27-05.jpg")

# Reshape the image to a 2D array of pixels
pixel_values = img.reshape((-1, 3))

# Convert pixel values to float
pixel_values = np.float32(pixel_values)

# Define the number of clusters (colors) to use
k = 26

# Define criteria and apply kmeans()
criteria = (cv2.TERM_CRITERIA_EPS + cv2.TERM_CRITERIA_MAX_ITER, 10, 1.0)
_, labels, centers = cv2.kmeans(pixel_values, k, None, criteria, 10, cv2.KMEANS_RANDOM_CENTERS)

# Convert the centers back to uint8 and reshape the labels back to the original image shape
centers = np.uint8(centers)
res = centers[labels.flatten()]
res2 = res.reshape((img.shape))

# Apply the wave effect to the image
h, w = img.shape[:2]
wave_x = 2 * w
wave_y = h
amount_x = 10
amount_y = 5
num_frames = 100
delay = 50
border_color = (128, 128, 128)
x = np.arange(w, dtype=np.float32)
y = np.arange(h, dtype=np.float32)
frames = []
for i in range(num_frames):
    phase_x = i * 360 / num_frames
    phase_y = phase_x
    x_sin = amount_x * np.sin(2 * np.pi * (x / wave_x + phase_x / 360)) + x
    map_x = np.tile(x_sin, (h, 1))
    y_sin = amount_y * np.sin(2 * np.pi * (y / wave_y + phase_y / 360)) + y
    map_y = np.tile(y_sin, (w, 1)).transpose()
    result = cv2.remap(img.copy(), map_x, map_y, cv2.INTER_LINEAR, borderMode=cv2.BORDER_CONSTANT, borderValue=border_color)
    frames.append(result)

# Save the frames as an MP4 video file
fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*'mp4v')
out = cv2.VideoWriter('animated.mp4', fourcc, 25.0, (w, h))
for frame in frames:
    out.write(frame)
out.release()
```

Note that the `cv2.VideoWriter` object is used to create a video file with the specified parameters. The `fourcc` argument specifies the codec used for encoding the video frames (in this case, "mp4v" for MP4). The `out.write(frame)` method is used to write each frame to the video file. Finally, the `out.release()` method is called to release the video writer and save the video file to disk.

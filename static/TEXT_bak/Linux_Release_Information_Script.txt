Sure, Jack! To get the Linux release information on your VPS, you can use the `lsb_release` command. This command provides information about the Linux distribution you are using, including the release number.

Here's a simple Python script that utilizes the `subprocess` module to execute the `lsb_release` command and retrieve the release information:

```python
import subprocess
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

def get_linux_release():
    try:
        # Execute the lsb_release command and capture the output
        output = subprocess.check_output(['lsb_release', '-a']).decode('utf-8')

        # Log the output
        logging.info("Linux Release Information:\n%s", output)

        # Parse the output to extract the release information
        release_info = {}
        for line in output.split('\n'):
            if ':' in line:
                key, value = line.split(':', 1)
                release_info[key.strip()] = value.strip()

        return release_info
    except Exception as e:
        logging.error("Error occurred while getting Linux release information: %s", e)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    linux_release = get_linux_release()
    if linux_release:
        print("Linux Release Information:")
        for key, value in linux_release.items():
            print(f"{key}: {value}")
    else:
        print("Failed to retrieve Linux release information. Please check the logs for details.")
```

This script will execute the `lsb_release -a` command, capture its output, log it for reference, and then parse the output to extract relevant information about your Linux release. Finally, it will print the release information to the console.

Feel free to run this script on your VPS to get the Linux release information. Let me know if you need further assistance!

Of course, Jack! If you prefer a Bash script to get the Linux release information on your VPS, you can use the `lsb_release` command directly within a Bash script.

Here's how you can do it:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Define a function to get Linux release information
get_linux_release() {
    # Execute the lsb_release command and capture the output
    release_info=$(lsb_release -a)

    # Print the release information
    echo "Linux Release Information:"
    echo "$release_info"
}

# Call the function to get Linux release information
get_linux_release
```

Save this script to a file, for example, `get_linux_release.sh`, on your VPS. Then, make it executable using the following command:

```bash
chmod +x get_linux_release.sh
```

Finally, you can run the script using:

```bash
./get_linux_release.sh
```

This will execute the script, which in turn runs the `lsb_release -a` command to retrieve the Linux release information and prints it to the console.

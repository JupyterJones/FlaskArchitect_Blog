This error message suggests that there is an issue with importing the `ngettext` function from the `gettext` module in Python. Specifically, the interpreter is unable to find the `ngettext` function from within the `gettext` module, and this is causing the program to fail.

It's possible that there is a naming conflict or some other issue with the `gettext.py` file in your working directory, as the path in the error message indicates that the file is located in a non-standard location on your system (`/mnt/HDD500/TENSORFLOW/gettext.py`).

To fix this error, you could try renaming the `gettext.py` file to something else to avoid any potential conflicts with the standard `gettext` module in Python. Alternatively, you could try removing the `gettext.py` file altogether and see if that resolves the issue.

It's also worth noting that this error message is coming from a Jupyter notebook or IPython kernel, so it's possible that there could be other issues with your notebook setup or environment that are contributing to this error. You could try restarting the notebook kernel or checking your Python environment to see if there are any other dependencies that might be causing conflicts.

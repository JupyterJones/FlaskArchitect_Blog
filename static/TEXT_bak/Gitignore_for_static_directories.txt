ChatGPT
Yes, Jack, the `.gitignore` directives you provided will indeed ignore the contents of the directories `/static/image_directories/` and `/static/assets_videos/`, as well as the directories themselves. 

Let me explain:

- `/static/image_directories/*`: This line tells Git to ignore all files and directories within `/static/image_directories/`, but not the directory itself. So, if there are any files or subdirectories inside `/static/image_directories/`, Git will ignore them.
- `/static/assets_videos/*`: Similarly, this line tells Git to ignore all files and directories within `/static/assets_videos/`, but not the directory itself.

So, if you have files or subdirectories within these directories, they won't be tracked by Git. However, the directories themselves (`/static/image_directories/` and `/static/assets_videos/`) will still exist in your repository. If you also want to ignore the directories themselves, you can modify the `.gitignore` file as follows:

```plaintext
/static/image_directories/
/static/assets_videos/
```

With these modifications, Git will ignore both the contents within these directories and the directories themselves.

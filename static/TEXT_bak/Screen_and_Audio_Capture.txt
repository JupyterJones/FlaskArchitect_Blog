To capture the screen and system audio (audio output) using `ffmpeg`, you can modify the command as follows:

```bash
ffmpeg -f x11grab -video_size 1360x768 -framerate 24 -i :0.0 \
-f pulse -i alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1f.3.analog-stereo.monitor -preset veryfast -crf 18 -pix_fmt yuv420p $pwd$d.mkv
```

Here's an explanation of the changes made:

1. Instead of using the `default` pulse audio input, we specify the monitor device for the system audio. The device name `alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1f.3.analog-stereo.monitor` is an example and may vary depending on your system configuration. You can use the `pactl` command or other tools to list the available audio devices and select the appropriate monitor device.

2. By using the system audio monitor, you will capture the audio output that would normally play through the speakers or headphones, rather than capturing the microphone input.

Make sure to replace `d` with the desired output filename or path, and ensure that you have write permissions to the directory where the output file will be saved.

how can I view my correct "alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1f.3.analog-stereo.monitor"
ChatGPT
To view the available audio devices in ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) and identify the correct monitor device for your system audio, you can use the `pactl` command-line tool. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open a terminal.

2. Run the following command to list the available audio devices:

   ```bash
   pactl list short sources
   ```

   This command will display a list of audio sources. Look for the line that represents the monitor device. It may have a name similar to `alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1f.3.analog-stereo.monitor`. Note down the exact name of the monitor device.

   Example output:
   ```
   0   alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1f.3.analog-stereo.monitor   module-alsa-card.c   s16le 2ch 44100Hz   SUSPENDED
   ```

3. Use the identified monitor device name in your `ffmpeg` command, as mentioned in the previous response.

   Note: The monitor device name can vary depending on your system configuration and sound card. Make sure to use the correct device name for your system.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify the correct monitor device for your system audio and use it in your `ffmpeg` command to capture screen and system audio.

1	alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo.monitor	module-alsa-card.c	s16le 2ch 44100HzIDLE
2	alsa_input.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo           what is the difference between 1 and 2 ?
ChatGPT
The difference between the two entries you provided, `alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo.monitor` and `alsa_input.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo`, is as follows:

1. `alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo.monitor`: This is the monitor device for the system audio output. It captures the audio that is being played through the speakers or headphones. It is typically used for capturing the audio output generated by applications or the operating system.

2. `alsa_input.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo`: This is the input device for the analog stereo audio input. It captures audio from external sources, such as a microphone or line-in connection. It is typically used for capturing audio from external devices or recording voice input.

In your case, if you want to capture the system audio output, you should use the monitor device `alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo.monitor` in your `ffmpeg` command. This will allow you to record the audio that is being played through your speakers or headphones, rather than capturing audio from a microphone or external device.

is it possible to boost the volume ?
ChatGPT
Yes, it is possible to boost the volume of the captured audio using `ffmpeg`. You can use the `-af` (audio filter) option to apply a volume adjustment filter.

Here's an example command that captures the screen, system audio, and boosts the volume by 10 decibels:

```bash
ffmpeg -f x11grab -video_size 1360x768 -framerate 24 -i :0.0 \
-f pulse -i alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo.monitor -preset veryfast -crf 18 -pix_fmt yuv420p -af "volume=10dB" $pwd$d.mkv
```

In this command, the `-af "volume=10dB"` option applies a volume adjustment of 10 decibels. You can modify the value as per your requirement to increase or decrease the volume. Positive values increase the volume, and negative values decrease it.

Make sure to replace `d` with the desired output filename or path, and ensure that you have write permissions to the directory where the output file will be saved.

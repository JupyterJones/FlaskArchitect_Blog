i have two partitions want to join together but they are not side by side 
ChatGPT
Sure, Jack! If you want to join two non-contiguous partitions into a single partition, you can use the following steps. Please note that this process involves using a tool called GParted, which you can install on your Linux machine.

1. **Install GParted:**
   Open a terminal and run the following command to install GParted:
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install gparted
   ```

2. **Open GParted:**
   After the installation is complete, run GParted with superuser privileges:
   ```bash
   sudo gparted
   ```

3. **Select the Partitions:**
   In GParted, select the partitions you want to merge. Right-click on the first partition and choose "Resize/Move."

4. **Resize the First Partition:**
   In the "Resize/Move" window, adjust the partition size to include the unallocated space next to it. Click "Resize/Move" to apply the changes.

5. **Move the Second Partition:**
   Right-click on the second partition and choose "Resize/Move." Move the partition to the beginning of the unallocated space. Click "Resize/Move" to apply the changes.

6. **Apply Changes:**
   Review the changes in the main GParted window. If everything looks correct, click the "Apply" button to perform the operations.

7. **Wait for Completion:**
   GParted will now merge the partitions. This process may take some time, depending on the size of your partitions and the speed of your disk.

8. **Reboot:**
   Once the process is complete, reboot your computer.

Remember to back up important data before making changes to your partitions, as operations like these always carry a slight risk. If you encounter any issues or have specific requirements, feel free to ask for more guidance.

they are separated by the boot efi
ChatGPT
Alright, Jack! If the two partitions you want to merge are separated by the EFI partition, the process is a bit more involved but still doable. We need to ensure that the EFI partition remains intact for system booting. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Backup Important Data:**
   Before making any changes to partitions, it's crucial to back up your important data.

2. **Create a Live USB:**
   Prepare a live USB with a Linux distribution. You can use tools like Rufus or balenaEtcher to create a bootable USB.

3. **Boot from Live USB:**
   Insert the live USB into your computer and boot from it. Most systems allow you to access the boot menu by pressing a key (often F2, F10, or F12) during startup.

4. **Open GParted on Live Environment:**
   Once you're booted into the live environment, open GParted.

5. **Move and Resize Partitions:**
   - Identify the EFI partition and make sure not to touch it.
   - Resize the first partition, moving it to the beginning of the unallocated space.
   - Resize the second partition, extending it to the end of the unallocated space.

6. **Apply Changes:**
   Review the changes in GParted and click "Apply" to execute them.

7. **Reinstall GRUB:**
   As you've modified partitions containing the boot data, you may need to reinstall GRUB. Open a terminal and run these commands:
   ```bash
   sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt    # Mount the root partition (replace X and Y with your root partition)
   sudo mount /dev/sdXY /mnt/boot/efi    # Mount the EFI partition
   sudo mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev
   sudo mount --bind /proc /mnt/proc
   sudo mount --bind /sys /mnt/sys
   sudo chroot /mnt
   grub-install /dev/sdX    # Replace X with your disk, usually /dev/sda
   update-grub
   exit
   ```

8. **Reboot:**
   Remove the live USB and restart your computer.

Remember, this process involves risks, so make sure you have a backup and are confident with the steps. If you encounter any issues or need clarification on any step, feel free to ask!

move docker to a 2nd hhd
ChatGPT
Certainly, Jack! Moving Docker to a second HDD involves a few steps. Let's go through the process:

1. **Install Docker on the Second HDD:**
   Ensure Docker is installed on the second HDD. If not, install Docker using your package manager.

2. **Stop Docker:**
   Stop the Docker service to prevent any issues during the move.
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop docker
   ```

3. **Move Docker Data Directory:**
   By default, Docker stores its data in the `/var/lib/docker` directory. We'll move this directory to the second HDD.

   a. Create a directory on the second HDD to store Docker data. Replace `/path/to/your/second/hdd` with the actual path.
   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /path/to/your/second/hdd/docker-data
   ```

   b. Copy the existing Docker data to the new location.
   ```bash
   sudo cp -a /var/lib/docker/. /path/to/your/second/hdd/docker-data
   ```

   c. Verify that the data has been copied successfully.

4. **Update Docker Configuration:**
   We need to update the Docker daemon configuration to point to the new data directory.

   a. Open the Docker daemon configuration file for editing.
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/docker/daemon.json
   ```

   b. Add or modify the "data-root" field to point to the new directory.
   ```json
   {
     "data-root": "/path/to/your/second/hdd/docker-data"
   }
   ```

   c. Save the changes and exit the editor.

5. **Restart Docker:**
   Restart the Docker service to apply the changes.
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart docker
   ```

6. **Verify:**
   Confirm that Docker is running and that the containers and images are accessible from the new location.

   ```bash
   docker info
   ```

That's it! Your Docker data should now be moved to the second HDD. Remember to adjust the paths according to your system configuration. If you face any issues or have questions about specific steps, feel free to ask.

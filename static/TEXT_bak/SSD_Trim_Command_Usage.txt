SSD Trim Command Usage
user
i have two ssd s will sudo fstrim -av trim them both ?
ChatGPT
Yes, running `sudo fstrim -av` will trim all mounted SSDs on your system. The `-a` option instructs `fstrim` to trim all eligible devices, and the `-v` option makes the command verbose, providing detailed output about the trimming process.

So, if you have two SSDs mounted on your system, `sudo fstrim -av` will trim both of them. This command is safe to run and helps maintain the performance and longevity of your SSDs by informing the SSD firmware which blocks are no longer in use, allowing them to be erased and made available for new data.

----------
but it says nothing about /dev/sdb my second drive
ChatGPT
If `sudo fstrim -av` doesn't report trimming for `/dev/sdb`, there could be several reasons for this:

1. **Not Mounted**: Check if `/dev/sdb` is actually mounted and accessible by the system. If it's not mounted, `fstrim` won't trim it.

2. **File System Type**: `fstrim` only works with certain file systems, such as ext4, xfs, and btrfs. If `/dev/sdb` is formatted with a different file system type, `fstrim` won't trim it.

3. **Manual Trim Required**: Some SSDs might require manual trimming or have specific requirements for trimming to be effective. Check the manufacturer's documentation for any specific instructions.

4. **Permissions**: Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to trim `/dev/sdb`.

5. **Error Reporting**: Sometimes, there could be errors or issues preventing `fstrim` from trimming `/dev/sdb`. Check system logs (`/var/log/syslog`, `/var/log/messages`, etc.) for any relevant error messages.

Double-check these points to see if any of them apply to your situation. If `/dev/sdb` is indeed mounted and meets all the requirements for trimming, and `fstrim` still doesn't trim it, there might be an underlying issue that requires further investigation.

how can i check this further terminal commands
ChatGPT
To further diagnose why `/dev/sdb` is not being trimmed by `fstrim`, you can perform the following checks in the terminal:

1. **Check Mount Status**:
   ```
   lsblk -o NAME,FSTYPE,MOUNTPOINT
   ```
   This command will list all block devices (`NAME`), their file system types (`FSTYPE`), and mount points (`MOUNTPOINT`). Verify if `/dev/sdb` is listed and if it has a mount point.

2. **Check File System Type**:
   ```
   sudo blkid /dev/sdb
   ```
   This command will display information about the file system type of `/dev/sdb`. Ensure it's a supported file system type for `fstrim`.

3. **Check if `/dev/sdb` is Mounted**:
   ```
   mount | grep /dev/sdb
   ```
   This command will search for any mounts related to `/dev/sdb`. If it's mounted, it will display the mount point.

4. **Check Permissions**:
   Ensure you have the necessary permissions to trim `/dev/sdb`:
   ```
   ls -l /dev/sdb
   ```
   This will display the permissions of `/dev/sdb`.

5. **Check System Logs**:
   ```
   sudo journalctl -xe | grep fstrim
   ```
   This command will search the system logs for any messages related to `fstrim` that might indicate why `/dev/sdb` is not being trimmed.

6. **Manual Trim**:
   You can also manually trigger trim for `/dev/sdb` using:
   ```
   sudo fstrim /path/to/mount/point
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/mount/point` with the actual mount point of `/dev/sdb`.

These commands should provide more insight into why `/dev/sdb` is not being trimmed by `fstrim`. If you encounter any errors or unexpected behavior, please feel free to share them for further assistance.

sudo fstrim /dev/sdb    ?
ChatGPT
Yes, you can use `sudo fstrim /dev/sdb` to manually trigger trim for the entire `/dev/sdb` device. This command will inform the SSD firmware to trim all unused blocks on the device.

However, please ensure that `/dev/sdb` is not mounted when you run this command to avoid potential data corruption. If `/dev/sdb` is mounted, unmount it first using `umount` command:

```bash
sudo umount /dev/sdb
```

Then, you can run the `fstrim` command:

```bash
sudo fstrim /dev/sdb
```

After running the `fstrim` command, you can remount `/dev/sdb` if needed.
user
sudo umount /dev/sdb
umount: /mnt/HDD500: target is busy.

ChatGPT
If you're encountering the "target is busy" error when trying to unmount `/dev/sdb`, it means that there are processes still accessing files or directories on that device. To successfully unmount it, you need to identify and stop those processes. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Identify Processes**: Determine which processes are currently using `/mnt/HDD500` (assuming that's the mount point of `/dev/sdb`). You can use the `fuser` command:
   ```bash
   sudo fuser -m /mnt/HDD500
   ```

2. **Terminate Processes**: Once you have identified the processes, you can terminate them using the `kill` command:
   ```bash
   sudo kill -9 <PID>
   ```
   Replace `<PID>` with the process ID (PID) of the processes obtained from the previous step.

3. **Retry Unmount**: After terminating the processes, try unmounting again:
   ```bash
   sudo umount /dev/sdb
   ```

4. **Check Again**: If the unmounting is successful, you can verify that `/dev/sdb` is no longer mounted by running:
   ```bash
   lsblk -o NAME,FSTYPE,MOUNTPOINT
   ```

Repeat the above steps until `/dev/sdb` is successfully unmounted. Once unmounted, you can proceed with running `sudo fstrim /dev/sdb` to manually trim the device.
user
sudo fuser -m /mnt/HDD500
/mnt/HDD500:          1698m

ChatGPT
The output of `sudo fuser -m /mnt/HDD500` indicates that process 1698 is currently using files or directories on the `/mnt/HDD500` mount point. To unmount the device successfully, you'll need to terminate this process. You can do this using the `kill` command with the `-9` option to force termination. Here's how:

```bash
sudo kill -9 1698
```

After executing this command, retry unmounting the `/dev/sdb` device:

```bash
sudo umount /dev/sdb
```

Once `/dev/sdb` is successfully unmounted, you can proceed with the `fstrim` command:

```bash
sudo fstrim /dev/sdb
```

This should allow you to manually trigger the trim operation on the `/dev/sdb` SSD.
user
sudo fstrim /mnt/HDD500
fstrim: /mnt/HDD500: the discard operation is not supported
ChatGPT
If the `fstrim` command reports that the discard operation is not supported on `/mnt/HDD500`, it indicates that the file system used on `/mnt/HDD500` does not support trimming.

This issue commonly occurs with file systems like NTFS or FAT32, which do not support the `fstrim` command for trimming SSDs.

To confirm the file system type of `/mnt/HDD500`, you can use the following command:

```bash
sudo blkid /dev/sdb
```

Replace `/dev/sdb` with the appropriate device name if needed.

If the file system type is NTFS or FAT32, you won't be able to use `fstrim` to trim the SSD. In such cases, trimming may be handled differently, or it might not be necessary at all, as some SSDs perform automatic garbage collection.

If `/mnt/HDD500` uses a file system that does support trimming (such as ext4, xfs, or btrfs), but `fstrim` still reports that the discard operation is not supported, there may be an issue with the configuration or compatibility of the file system driver. In such cases, you might need to consult the documentation or support resources for your specific file system and operating system for further assistance.
user
sudo blkid /dev/sdb
/dev/sdb: LABEL="HDD500" UUID="73777e11-76da-4fee-ba95-e731ac3ca459" TYPE="ext4"

ChatGPT
Thanks for providing the information. Since `/dev/sdb` is formatted with the `ext4` file system, trimming should be supported.

The error message "the discard operation is not supported" usually occurs when the file system is mounted with the `discard` option disabled. This option enables or disables the automatic trimming feature of the file system.

To enable trimming for the `ext4` file system, you can remount it with the `discard` option enabled. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
sudo mount -o remount,discard /mnt/HDD500
```

This command remounts the `/mnt/HDD500` directory with the `discard` option enabled, allowing `fstrim` to work properly. After running this command, try running `sudo fstrim /mnt/HDD500` again to trim the SSD.
user
sudo mount -o remount,discard /mnt/HDD500
(base) jack@jack-Desktop:~$ sudo fstrim /dev/sdb
fstrim: /dev/sdb: not a directory
(base) jack@jack-Desktop:~$ sudo fstrim /mnt/HDD500
fstrim: /mnt/HDD500: the discard operation is not supported
ChatGPT
It seems there's a misunderstanding in the usage of the `fstrim` command. 

When using `fstrim`, you should specify the mount point of the file system, not the device itself. Let's correct that:

```bash
sudo fstrim /mnt/HDD500
```

This command should trim the `/mnt/HDD500` file system, which corresponds to the `/dev/sdb` device.

If you encounter the "discard operation is not supported" error again, it might be due to a configuration issue or limitation with your system. In such cases, you can try an alternative approach:

```bash
sudo systemctl start fstrim.timer
```

This command starts the `fstrim` timer service, which automatically trims eligible file systems once a week by default. This might help ensure regular trimming of your SSD without manual intervention.
user
sudo systemctl start fstrim.timer
start or enable ?
ChatGPT
My apologies for the oversight. To start the `fstrim.timer` service, you should use the `enable` command to ensure it starts automatically at boot, and then use the `start` command to start it immediately. Here's the correct sequence:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable fstrim.timer
sudo systemctl start fstrim.timer
```

Enabling the service ensures that it starts automatically upon system boot, while starting it immediately ensures that it runs the scheduled trim operations according to its configuration. Thank you for catching that mistake!
user
I think i have a problem with /mnt/HDD500
sometimes it reads and reads continuosly ?
ChatGPT
If you're experiencing continuous reading activity on `/mnt/HDD500`, it could indicate several potential issues:

1. **Background Processes**: There might be background processes accessing files or directories on `/mnt/HDD500`, causing continuous reading activity. You can use tools like `iotop` or `htop` to monitor disk I/O and identify any active processes causing the reading activity.

2. **File System Corruption**: File system corruption can sometimes lead to abnormal disk activity. Running a file system check (`fsck`) on `/dev/sdb` can help identify and repair any corruption issues.

3. **Disk Errors**: Physical disk errors or bad sectors can also cause continuous reading activity as the system attempts to read and recover data. Checking the disk's SMART status using tools like `smartctl` can provide information about the disk's health.

4. **Misconfigured Applications**: Misconfigured applications or services may continuously read/write data to the disk, leading to high disk activity. Reviewing the configuration of any applications or services accessing `/mnt/HDD500` can help identify and resolve any issues.

5. **Hardware Issues**: In some cases, hardware issues such as a failing disk or malfunctioning disk controller can cause continuous disk activity. Checking system logs (`/var/log/syslog`, `/var/log/messages`, etc.) for any disk-related errors can provide clues about potential hardware issues.

6. **Background Indexing**: Some applications or services, such as file indexers or search engines, may perform background indexing of files on the disk, leading to continuous disk activity. Disabling or adjusting the settings of these services can help reduce disk activity.

Investigating these potential causes can help identify and resolve the issue of continuous reading activity on `/mnt/HDD500`. If you need further assistance with troubleshooting or resolving any specific issue, feel free to provide more details, and I'll be glad to help.

fsck /dev/sdb
while mounted ?
ChatGPT
Running `fsck` on a mounted file system can lead to data corruption or other unpredictable behavior. It's essential to unmount the file system before running `fsck` to ensure the integrity of the file system check.

Here's the correct sequence to unmount the file system, run `fsck`, and then remount it:

1. **Unmount the File System**:
   ```bash
   sudo umount /mnt/HDD500
   ```

2. **Run `fsck`**:
   ```bash
   sudo fsck /dev/sdb
   ```

3. **Remount the File System**:
   ```bash
   sudo mount /mnt/HDD500
   ```

Make sure to replace `/mnt/HDD500` with the actual mount point of `/dev/sdb`. After running `fsck`, it will report any issues it finds and prompt you to fix them. Follow the prompts as necessary to repair any detected problems with the file system.

Once the file system check is complete and any issues are resolved, you can remount the file system to make it accessible again.
user
sudo umount /mnt/HDD500
umount: /mnt/HDD500: target is busy.
it is always busy
ChatGPT
If you're unable to unmount the `/mnt/HDD500` directory because it's always busy, it indicates that there are still active processes accessing files or directories on that mount point. To successfully unmount it, you'll need to identify and stop those processes. Here's how you can proceed:

1. **Identify Processes**: Determine which processes are currently using `/mnt/HDD500`. You can use the `lsof` command to list open files associated with the mount point:
   ```bash
   sudo lsof /mnt/HDD500
   ```

2. **Terminate Processes**: Once you have identified the processes, you can terminate them using the `kill` command:
   ```bash
   sudo kill -9 <PID>
   ```
   Replace `<PID>` with the process ID (PID) of the processes obtained from the previous step.

3. **Retry Unmount**: After terminating the processes, try unmounting the `/mnt/HDD500` directory again:
   ```bash
   sudo umount /mnt/HDD500
   ```

4. **Force Unmount**: If the directory is still reported as busy, you can force unmount it using the `-f` option with `umount`:
   ```bash
   sudo umount -f /mnt/HDD500
   ```

   Be cautious when using the `-f` option, as it forcefully unmounts the directory without regard for active processes. This can potentially lead to data corruption if files are being accessed.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully unmount the `/mnt/HDD500` directory even if it's busy. After unmounting, you can proceed with running `fsck` on the `/dev/sdb` device.
user
sudo lsof /mnt/HDD500
lsof: WARNING: can't stat() fuse.gvfsd-fuse file system /run/user/1000/gvfs
      Output information may be incomplete.
lsof: WARNING: can't stat() fuse file system /run/user/1000/doc
      Output information may be incomplete.

ChatGPT
It seems that `lsof` is unable to fully analyze the file system due to limitations with the FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) file systems mounted under `/run/user/1000/`. These warnings are common and usually not a cause for concern.

To further investigate processes accessing files on `/mnt/HDD500`, you can try the following command:

```bash
sudo lsof +D /mnt/HDD500
```

This command specifically lists open files within the `/mnt/HDD500` directory, bypassing any issues with FUSE file systems. It should provide a more accurate view of processes accessing files on that mount point.

Once you identify the processes, you can proceed with terminating them using the `kill` command as mentioned earlier. After ensuring no active processes are accessing files on `/mnt/HDD500`, you should be able to successfully unmount it.
user
sudo lsof +D /mnt/HDD500
lsof: WARNING: can't stat() fuse.gvfsd-fuse file system /run/user/1000/gvfs
      Output information may be incomplete.
lsof: WARNING: can't stat() fuse file system /run/user/1000/doc
      Output information may be incomplete.

ChatGPT
It appears that `lsof` is still encountering issues with FUSE file systems, which may limit the completeness of its output. However, despite the warnings, `lsof` should still provide some information about processes accessing files within the `/mnt/HDD500` directory.

If `lsof` is unable to provide the necessary information, another approach to identify processes accessing `/mnt/HDD500` is by using the `fuser` command. You can try the following:

```bash
sudo fuser -v /mnt/HDD500
```

This command will display the PID (Process ID) of any processes accessing files within the `/mnt/HDD500` directory. You can then use these PIDs to terminate the corresponding processes if needed.

Once you've ensured that no active processes are accessing `/mnt/HDD500`, you should be able to unmount it successfully. If you encounter any further issues or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!
user
sudo fuser -v /mnt/HDD500
                     USER        PID ACCESS COMMAND
/mnt/HDD500:         root     kernel mount /mnt/HDD500
ChatGPT
It seems that the `/mnt/HDD500` directory is currently being accessed by the kernel itself, which is likely the reason why it cannot be unmounted. 

When the kernel is accessing a mount point, it's typically because the file system is still in use, even if there are no visible processes accessing it. This can happen due to various reasons, such as internal file system operations or background tasks.

To proceed, you can try forcing the unmount using the `-f` option with `umount`:

```bash
sudo umount -f /mnt/HDD500
```

The `-f` option will attempt to forcibly unmount the directory, overriding any ongoing operations. However, be cautious when using this option, as it may lead to data loss or corruption if files are being actively accessed.

If even with the `-f` option you encounter issues unmounting `/mnt/HDD500`, it might be indicative of a deeper issue with the file system or the disk itself. In such cases, you may need to further investigate or seek assistance to resolve the underlying problem.
user
sudo fstrim -v /mnt/HDD500
/mnt/HDD500: 12.1 MiB (12713984 bytes) trimmed
ChatGPT
It appears that the `fstrim` command was able to successfully trim the `/mnt/HDD500` directory, indicating that the file system is indeed mounted and accessible. This contradicts the previous issue where `/mnt/HDD500` couldn't be unmounted due to being busy.

Since `fstrim` was able to trim the directory, it suggests that the file system was indeed mounted and accessible. This implies that there might have been a temporary issue preventing the unmounting process earlier.

You can verify the mount status of `/mnt/HDD500` by using the `mount` command:

```bash
mount | grep /mnt/HDD500
```

If it shows that `/mnt/HDD500` is indeed mounted, then you should be able to interact with it as expected. If you encounter any further issues or inconsistencies, feel free to ask for assistance.

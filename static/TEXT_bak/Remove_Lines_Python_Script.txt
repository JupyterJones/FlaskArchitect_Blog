To remove a span of lines from a text file, such as lines 72 to 400000, you can read the file line by line, skipping the lines within the specified range, and then write the remaining lines to a new file. Here's a Python script to achieve this, along with detailed logging:

```python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)  # Set logging level to INFO

def remove_lines(input_file, output_file, start, end):
    """
    Remove lines from input_file starting from line start to line end (inclusive),
    and write the result to output_file.
    """
    logging.info(f"Removing lines {start}-{end} from {input_file}...")
    with open(input_file, 'r') as f_in, open(output_file, 'w') as f_out:
        line_number = 0
        for line in f_in:
            line_number += 1
            if line_number < start or line_number > end:
                f_out.write(line)
    logging.info(f"Lines {start}-{end} removed successfully. Result saved to {output_file}")

# Example usage:
input_file = 'input.txt'
output_file = 'output.txt'
start_line = 72
end_line = 400000

remove_lines(input_file, output_file, start_line, end_line)
```

This script defines a function `remove_lines` that takes an input file path, output file path, start line number, and end line number. It then reads the input file line by line, skipping lines within the specified range, and writes the remaining lines to the output file.

You can adjust the `input_file`, `output_file`, `start_line`, and `end_line` variables according to your specific requirements. After running this script, the lines from 72 to 400000 in the input file will be removed, and the result will be saved to the output file.

can i use bash
ChatGPT
Certainly! You can achieve this using bash commands as well. You can use `sed` command to delete lines within a specified range. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

input_file="input.txt"
output_file="output.txt"
start_line=72
end_line=400000

# Remove lines within the specified range and save the result to output file
sed -e "${start_line},${end_line}d" "$input_file" > "$output_file"

echo "Lines $start_line-$end_line removed successfully. Result saved to $output_file"
```

Save this script to a file, let's say `remove_lines.sh`, make it executable using `chmod +x remove_lines.sh`, and then run it using `./remove_lines.sh`.

This script uses `sed` command with the range specified as `${start_line},${end_line}d` to delete lines from `start_line` to `end_line` (inclusive) from the input file, and then redirects the output to the specified output file.

Adjust the `input_file`, `output_file`, `start_line`, and `end_line` variables according to your specific requirements. After running this script, the lines from 72 to 400000 in the input file will be removed, and the result will be saved to the output file.

a one liner
ChatGPT
Sure, you can achieve this with a one-liner using `sed`:

```bash
sed '72,400000d' input.txt > output.txt
```

This command will remove lines 72 to 400000 from the `input.txt` file and save the result to `output.txt`.

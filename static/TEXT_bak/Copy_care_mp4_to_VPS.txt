Certainly, Jack! To copy the `care.mp4` file to your VPS at `/var/www/flaskarchitect/caregiver/videos`, you can use the `scp` command. Assuming you're copying from your local machine to the VPS, the command would look something like this:

```bash
scp /path/to/local/care.mp4 username@your_vps_ip:/var/www/flaskarchitect/caregiver/videos
```

Replace `/path/to/local/care.mp4` with the actual path to your `care.mp4` file on your local machine. Also, replace `username` with your VPS username and `your_vps_ip` with the actual IP address of your VPS.

If you're running this command from your Linux computer, it should prompt you for the password associated with the VPS user account.

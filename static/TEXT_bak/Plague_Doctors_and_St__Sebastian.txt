I appreciate your interest in historical topics, but it seems like your request is not directly related to your profile as a Python developer and your current focus on AI-related projects. However, I'd be happy to discuss the history of plague doctors and the Black Death briefly if it piques your curiosity.

Plague doctors were medical practitioners during the time of the Black Death in the 14th century and later outbreaks of the plague. They wore distinctive clothing, which included a long, waxed coat, a wide-brimmed hat, and a beaked mask filled with aromatic substances. The beak-shaped mask was believed to protect them from inhaling contaminated air. They also carried a cane to examine patients without direct contact.

The Black Death, which struck Europe in the mid-14th century, was one of the deadliest pandemics in human history, wiping out a significant portion of the population. It caused severe fevers, painful lymph node swellings, and respiratory symptoms. The precise origin of the Black Death remains a subject of debate among historians, but it had devastating effects.

St. Sebastian, as you mentioned, became a popular saint during this time, as people turned to faith and prayer to seek protection and relief from the plague. His image was often depicted in artworks like the one from the church of Saint-Crepin-Ibouvillers in France, reflecting the desperation of the era.

My apologies for misunderstanding your question earlier. Without explicit information about your GPT-4o limit, I can't provide precise details. However, typically, usage limits for language models like GPT-4o are determined by factors such as the number of tokens processed, the duration of usage, or specific subscription plans. If you're uncertain about your limit, it's best to refer to the terms of service or contact the service provider for clarification.

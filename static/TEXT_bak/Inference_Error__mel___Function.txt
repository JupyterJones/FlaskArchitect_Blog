The error message suggests that the `mel()` function in the `librosa.filters` module is being called with incorrect arguments. The `mel()` function is expecting zero positional arguments, but it is receiving two positional arguments and three keyword-only arguments.

To resolve this issue, you need to review the code and ensure that the `mel()` function is called correctly with the appropriate arguments. It seems like the problem originates from the `_build_mel_basis()` function in the `audio.py` file.

Make sure that the `librosa.filters.mel()` function is called with the correct arguments, including the `sample_rate`, `n_fft`, and `n_mels` parameters. These arguments should be provided in the correct order and with the appropriate values based on your specific use case.

Double-check the documentation or examples of the library you are using to ensure that you are calling the `mel()` function correctly.

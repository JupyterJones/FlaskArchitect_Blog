To livestream to YouTube using FFmpeg with your microphone and audio output, you can use the following command:

```
ffmpeg -f alsa -i pulse -f x11grab -s 1280x720 -i :0.0 -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -pix_fmt yuv420p -c:a aac -b:a 128k -f flv rtmp://yourstreamkeyhere
```

This command assumes that you are using PulseAudio as your audio input and that your display is set to 1280x720 resolution. If your audio input is different, replace "pulse" with the appropriate input device, such as "hw:0,0" for the default audio device.

Replace "yourstreamkeyhere" with the RTMP URL provided by YouTube for your livestream. This can be found on the YouTube Live Control Room page.

When you run the command, FFmpeg will capture your audio and video input, encode it using the libx264 video codec and the AAC audio codec, and stream it to YouTube using the RTMP URL you provided.

Note that before starting the livestream, you should make sure that your audio levels are set correctly and that your microphone and audio output are working properly.

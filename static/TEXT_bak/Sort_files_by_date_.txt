Sort files by date.
user
i have a list of files/paths 
i want to list them with/by date of creation oldest first

Certainly! You can achieve this using the `os.path.getctime` function in Python to get the creation time of each file and then sort the list of files based on their creation time. Here's a complete script that does this and includes logging for better understanding:

```python
import os
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(message)s')

def list_files_by_creation_time(file_paths):
    """
    List files by their creation time, oldest first.
    
    Args:
    file_paths (list): List of file paths.
    
    Returns:
    list: List of file paths sorted by creation time.
    """
    # Log the start of the function
    logging.info('Listing files by creation time...')
    
    # Create a dictionary to store file paths and their creation times
    file_creation_times = {}
    
    # Iterate through each file path
    for file_path in file_paths:
        # Get the creation time of the file
        try:
            creation_time = os.path.getctime(file_path)
            # Store the file path and its creation time in the dictionary
            file_creation_times[file_path] = creation_time
        except FileNotFoundError:
            # Log a warning if the file is not found
            logging.warning(f'File not found: {file_path}')
    
    # Sort the dictionary by creation time
    sorted_files = sorted(file_creation_times.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    # Extract the file paths from the sorted list
    sorted_file_paths = [file_path for file_path, _ in sorted_files]
    
    # Log the end of the function
    logging.info('File listing complete.')
    
    # Return the sorted file paths
    return sorted_file_paths

# Example list of file paths
file_paths = [
    '/path/to/file1.txt',
    '/path/to/file2.txt',
    '/path/to/file3.txt'
]

# Call the function to list files by creation time
sorted_files = list_files_by_creation_time(file_paths)

# Log the sorted file paths
logging.info('Sorted files by creation time:')
for file_path in sorted_files:
    logging.info(file_path)
```

This script defines a function `list_files_by_creation_time` which takes a list of file paths as input and returns a list of file paths sorted by creation time. It uses `os.path.getctime` to get the creation time of each file, stores the file paths and creation times in a dictionary, sorts the dictionary based on creation time, and returns the sorted list of file paths.

You can replace the `file_paths` list with your actual list of file paths. After running the script, it will log the sorted file paths with the oldest file first.

the list is in a file

Got it. If the list of file paths is stored in a file, you can modify the script to read the file and then list the files by their creation time. Here's the updated script:

```python
import os
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(message)s')

def list_files_by_creation_time(file_paths_file):
    """
    List files by their creation time, oldest first.
    
    Args:
    file_paths_file (str): Path to the file containing list of file paths.
    
    Returns:
    list: List of file paths sorted by creation time.
    """
    # Log the start of the function
    logging.info('Listing files by creation time...')
    
    # Create an empty list to store file paths
    file_paths = []
    
    # Read the file containing list of file paths
    try:
        with open(file_paths_file, 'r') as f:
            # Read each line in the file and strip trailing newline characters
            file_paths = [line.strip() for line in f.readlines()]
    except FileNotFoundError:
        # Log an error if the file is not found
        logging.error(f'File not found: {file_paths_file}')
        return []
    
    # Create a dictionary to store file paths and their creation times
    file_creation_times = {}
    
    # Iterate through each file path
    for file_path in file_paths:
        # Get the creation time of the file
        try:
            creation_time = os.path.getctime(file_path)
            # Store the file path and its creation time in the dictionary
            file_creation_times[file_path] = creation_time
        except FileNotFoundError:
            # Log a warning if the file is not found
            logging.warning(f'File not found: {file_path}')
    
    # Sort the dictionary by creation time
    sorted_files = sorted(file_creation_times.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    # Extract the file paths from the sorted list
    sorted_file_paths = [file_path for file_path, _ in sorted_files]
    
    # Log the end of the function
    logging.info('File listing complete.')
    
    # Return the sorted file paths
    return sorted_file_paths

# Path to the file containing list of file paths
file_paths_file = '/path/to/file_paths.txt'

# Call the function to list files by creation time
sorted_files = list_files_by_creation_time(file_paths_file)

# Log the sorted file paths
logging.info('Sorted files by creation time:')
for file_path in sorted_files:
    logging.info(file_path)
```

Replace `'/path/to/file_paths.txt'` with the actual path to your file containing the list of file paths. After running the script, it will read the file, list the files by their creation time, and log the sorted file paths with the oldest file first.

Jack, rebuilding thumbnails on Linux can be done by clearing the thumbnail cache and letting the system regenerate them. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Clear the Thumbnail Cache:**
   - Open a terminal on your Linux computer.

   - Depending on your Linux distribution and desktop environment, you might have different locations for the thumbnail cache. Common cache directories are `~/.cache/thumbnails` and `~/.thumbnails`. You can navigate to the cache directory using the `cd` command in the terminal. For example:

     ```bash
     cd ~/.cache/thumbnails
     ```

   - Once you're in the cache directory, you can remove all the files. Be careful with this command, as it will remove all thumbnails, and the system will regenerate them as needed.

     ```bash
     rm -r *
     ```

2. **Regenerate Thumbnails:**
   - After clearing the cache, you don't need to manually regenerate the thumbnails. Your Linux desktop environment (e.g., GNOME, KDE) will automatically regenerate thumbnails as you browse directories or view images.

3. **Log Out and Log In (Optional):**
   - In some cases, you might need to log out and log back in to see the regenerated thumbnails take effect. This step is usually not necessary, but if you don't see the new thumbnails immediately, you can try it.

That's it! Your Linux system should now start regenerating thumbnails as you interact with your files and directories. If you encounter any issues or if you have a specific desktop environment in mind, please let me know, and I can provide more detailed instructions tailored to your setup.

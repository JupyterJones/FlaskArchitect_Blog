Certainly, Jack! I'd be happy to help you add a route to your Flask application for finding and displaying MP4 files from the `static/final_videos` directory. I'll provide you with a complete script and explanations along with logging. Let's get started.

First, ensure that you have the Flask framework installed in your environment as per your provided module list. If it's not installed, you can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install flask
```

Now, let's create a Flask application with the necessary route and HTML page.

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

# Define the path to the final videos directory
final_videos_dir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)), 'static', 'final_videos')

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return "Welcome to my Flask application!"

@app.route('/find_mp4')
def find_mp4():
    # List all MP4 files in the final_videos directory
    mp4_files = [f for f in os.listdir(final_videos_dir) if f.endswith('.mp4')]
    
    # Log the list of MP4 files
    app.logger.info("List of MP4 files: %s", mp4_files)
    
    return render_template('display.html', mp4_files=mp4_files)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

Now, let's create the `display.html` template. Create a folder named `templates` in the same directory as your main script if it doesn't already exist. Inside the `templates` folder, create a file named `display.html` with the following content:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>MP4 Files</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>List of MP4 Files:</h1>
    <ul>
        {% for mp4_file in mp4_files %}
            <li><a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='final_videos/' + mp4_file) }}">{{ mp4_file }}</a></li>
        {% endfor %}
    </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

Now, let's explain what we've done:

1. We created a new route `/find_mp4` that lists all the `.mp4` files in the `static/final_videos` directory and renders the `display.html` template to display them.

2. We use the `os` module to get the list of MP4 files in the directory and log this list for debugging purposes using Flask's built-in logging.

3. The `display.html` template lists the MP4 files with hyperlinks to each file so that users can click to view or download them.

Remember to place your MP4 files inside the `static/final_videos` directory.

To run the Flask application, simply execute your script, and it should start the development server:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

You can access the `/find_mp4` route in your browser to view the list of MP4 files.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.

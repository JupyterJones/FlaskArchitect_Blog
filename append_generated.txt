what sites can i visit in Washington DC?" | "You're welcome!" she replied. "I'll have a look. I'll see you there."
She headed to the nearest department store and ordered the two things, then went to the nearest station in the city to buy the food. | She was surprised that no one was there to check on her.
"Oh, what's it like to be on the other side of town?" she asked as she got to her feet. "It's not the best place to be a little girl. And there's also not a lot of money there. | It's a lot of dirty, dirty clothes, but you know what? It's just a little place with the most beautiful scenery. You're always welcome."
"So you're a little girl?" | "No, it's not. It's really just the people in the town. I like the smell of the town, the smell of the town. And I like the smell of the people in the city."
"You're a little girl?" | "No."
She looked down and saw a group of people outside her window. | "I'm coming for you. We're trying to get a new house. It's a nice, clean house. And it's like you said, the people here are really nice. And the food is delicious, too."
"I'm coming for you. We're trying to get a new house. It's a nice, clean house. And it's like you said, the people here are really nice. And the food is delicious, too."
"Are you kidding me?" | "No."
"I'm coming!" they shouted. | "I mean, I'm an average girl. But I'm getting more and more into it. And I can make it to Washington DC."
"I don't know. I'm really into it. I'm into all things beautiful. | I don't want to go to Washington DC.
I want to come to Washington DC. I want to go to Washington DC." | "I think you're too smart to do that!"
"What are you doing here?!" she asked as they got out. | "What do you mean, 'I'm coming?' I mean, you're here for a little girl."
"That's really weird." | "I'm coming for you. We're trying to get a new house.
It's a nice, clean house. | And it's like you said, the people here are really nice. And the food is delicious, too."
"Are you kidding me?" | "No."
"Yeah. It's just a beautiful town." | "Do you think you can make it to Washington DC?"
"I think you're too smart to do that!" | "Yeah."
